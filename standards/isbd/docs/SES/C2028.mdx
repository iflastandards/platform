# Resource Identifier Statement Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This refers to element **8.1** within the **Resource Identifier and Terms of Availability Area (Area 8)**. It provides a **number or alphanumeric designation** that uniquely identifies a resource. This can include international standard identifiers (like ISBN, ISSN, ISMN, URN, DOI, URL) or designations assigned by a publisher (like publisher's numbers, plate numbers, or label names with catalogue numbers). For older monographic resources and music manuscripts, it also includes "Fingerprint" and "Music incipit" as identifiers.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
The element is **Optional**.
- **Standard identifier (Optional):** Recorded with its customary label (e.g., "ISBN 978-952-92-0267-6," "ISSN 0075-2363," "doi:10.1000/1").
- **Publisher's number (Optional, for notated music):** Preceded by "Publ. no.".
- **Plate number (Optional, for notated music):** Preceded by "Pl. no.".
- **Qualification to identifier (Optional):** A brief statement in parentheses to qualify, explain, or correct the identifier (e.g., "(cloth)", "(corrected)", "(invalid)").
- **Label name and catalogue number (Optional, for sound/videorecordings):** The label name followed by all catalogue numbers supplied by the issuing company (e.g., "Telefunken 6.35368").
- **Fingerprint (Mandatory if available, for older monographic resources):** An alphanumeric string derived from the text (e.g., "163704 - b1 A2 ,$en : b2 I2 a,$").
- **Music incipit (Optional, for music manuscripts):** A series of notes from a musical work, serving as an identifier.

</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
- The identifier is the **first element** in its statement within Area 8 and is not preceded by prescribed punctuation.
- **Qualifications** are enclosed in **parentheses ( )**. Multiple qualifications are separated by **;**.
- If **multiple identifiers** for the same resource (e.g., for different formats or parts) are given by repeating the area, each subsequent statement is preceded by **. —**.
- A **plate number** following an ISBN or publisher's number is preceded by **. —**.

</div>

## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
This is element **8.1** within Area 8. It provides standardized, unique identification for resources, aiding in their discovery and management.
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
- It is a component of the "Resource Identifier And Terms Of Availability Area Encoding Scheme."
- It directly relates to the "Key title" (element 8.2), which is given only if the ISSN (a type of resource identifier) is also given.
- Identifiers for earlier editions or bibliographic history are not given here but may be recorded in the **Note Area (Area 7)**.

</div>
