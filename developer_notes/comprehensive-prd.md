# IFLA Standards Development Platform - Comprehensive PRD

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the comprehensive redesign of the IFLA Standards Development Platform from a single-type monorepo to a multi-type monorepo architecture that properly aligns with IFLA's organizational structure and workflow requirements.

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Multi-type monorepo**: Docusaurus for namespace documentation, Next.js for admin applications, Node/TypeScript/Python for tools
- **IFLA hierarchy alignment**: Review Group → Namespace → Element Sets + Concept Schemes
- **Simplified CI/CD**: Preview branch → Main branch deployment
- **Comprehensive authorization**: GitHub OAuth + Cerbos policy engine
- **Vercel deployment**: Edge Functions for serverless operations

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure Assessment

**Current Structure Problems:**
- 1 site = 1 standard (doesn't match IFLA hierarchy)
- Complex CI/CD with multiple environments
- Inconsistent authorization boundaries
- Scattered activity management across components

**Current Capabilities (63+ Activities Identified):**
- Content Management (15 activities)
- RDF & Vocabularies (12 activities)
- Review & Workflow (8 activities)
- Team Management (7 activities)
- Releases & Publishing (6 activities)
- Quality Assurance (8 activities)
- Development Tools (7 activities)

### IFLA Organizational Structure

**4 Review Groups:**
1. **ICP (International Cataloguing Principles)**
   - MulDiCat Namespace (1 Concept Scheme)

2. **BCM (Bibliographic Conceptual Models)**
   - FRBR Namespace (4 Element Sets, 2 Concept Schemes)
   - LRM Namespace (1 Element Set)

3. **ISBD (International Standard Bibliographic Description)**
   - ISBD Namespace (2 Element Sets, 7 Concept Schemes)
   - ISBD-LRM Namespace (9 Element Sets, 11 Concept Schemes, 12 Syntax Encoding Schemes)

4. **PUC (Permanent UNIMARC Committee)**
   - UNIMARC Namespace (30 Element Sets, 40+ Concept Schemes)

**Authorization Hierarchy:**
- Superadmin (global access)
- Review Group Admin (namespace creation/deletion)
- Namespace Admin (element set management)
- Namespace Editor (elements/concepts CRUD)
- Namespace Translator (language-specific editing)
- Namespace Reviewer (pull requests, discussions)

## Conclusion

This comprehensive PRD outlines the complete transformation of the IFLA Standards Development Platform from a single-type to a multi-type monorepo architecture. The new system will properly align with IFLA's organizational structure, provide comprehensive workflow tools, and support the full spectrum of standards development activities.

The implementation plan spans 7 weeks with clear phases, dependencies, and deliverables. Success will be measured through technical performance, user experience, and business impact metrics. Risk mitigation strategies ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to ongoing work.

The result will be a modern, scalable platform that supports IFLA's mission of advancing international standards development while providing efficient tools for content creators, reviewers, translators, and administrators.
