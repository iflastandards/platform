## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and purpose:**  To provide the statement of responsibility relating to a secondary edition statement (reprint, reissue, etc.) in a parallel language or script, when available. This enhances the international utility of the description and can aid in identification.
- **User tasks supported:** Disambiguation of resources with multiple reprint/reissue statements, identification of individuals/entities responsible for reprints or reissues in different language editions.

## Element Values

- **Specific rules or guidelines:** The statement is transcribed as it appears on the resource. Standard abbreviations as listed in A.6 and Appendix D may be used.
- **Value constraints or formats:** Should relate to the individual or entity responsible for the additional edition statement.
- **String encoding schemes:**  Follows the encoding scheme of the title proper (A.5).

## Examples

```
... - 2nd ed., reissued, 2nd impression / revised by J. Smith = 2e éd., réimprimée, 2e tirage / révisée par J. Dubois, ...
```

```
... -  3rd ed., reprinted with corrections / A.B. Jones = 3. Aufl., Nachdruck mit Korrekturen / A.B. Müller, ...
```

```
... -  Rev. ed., 2nd printing, student version / prepared by K. Miller = Éd. rév., 2e tirage, version étudiante / préparée par A. Dufour, ...
```


## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** Directly related to the additional edition statement (2.4) and the statement of responsibility relating to the edition (2.3). Also related to parallel edition statement (2.2).  Part of the broader Edition Area (2).
- **Super-types/sub-types:** This is a specific type of "Statement of Responsibility relating to an Edition Statement."
- **Inverse relationships:**  None specifically defined in ISBD.


## Stipulations

- **Special considerations/usage notes:** Only present if both an additional edition statement and a parallel statement are present on the resource. Only required if considered important for identification or to users.
- **Best practices:** Apply when both an additional edition statement and a statement of responsibility exist in parallel languages or scripts on the resource. Transcribe accurately, using authorized abbreviations when appropriate. Consider omitting if the responsibility is the same as for the main edition statement.
