# has dependent title designation of parallel title

The ISBD element "dependent title designation of parallel title" (isbd:elements/P1184) is not explicitly defined in the provided ISBD documentation.  The closest element is the general "Dependent title designation," which applies to both the title proper and the parallel title. There is no separate definition or treatment specified for the parallel title's dependent title designation. Therefore, the following response is based on the general "Dependent title designation" and how it applies in the context of a parallel title.

## Element Reference

The ISBD defines "Dependent title designation" as:

> Numbering following the common title, that alone or in conjunction with a dependent title serves to distinguish one of two or more related resources having a common title (see also section designation; subseries designation)

While not explicitly stated in the document, based on usage, the domain would be a *parallel title* consisting of a common title and a dependent title, and the range would be a string representing the designation (e.g., "Part 1," "Vol. 2," "Module A").  

Element type:  String

## Additional Information

Scope and Purpose:  This element, when applied to a parallel title, provides a further level of specification within a larger work, particularly when that work has multiple parts or sections. It helps differentiate the specific part or section being described within the parallel title. This is most relevant in multilingual or multi-script contexts where a resource is part of a larger series.

User tasks supported: Identifying a specific part of a resource within a parallel title, facilitating disambiguation and retrieval in multilingual catalogs.

## Element Values

Specific rules: The dependent title designation of a parallel title should be transcribed as it appears on the resource.

Value constraints: Should accurately reflect the designation given on the resource.

String encoding schemes:  UTF-8 is generally recommended for ISBD.


## Examples

```
(Common Title. Vol. 2 = Parallel Common Title. Band 2)
```

```
(Multimedia Encyclopedia. Module A: Physics = Encyclopédie Multimédia. Module A : Physique)
```

```
(Great Britain. England = Grande Bretagne. Angleterre)
```

```
(World Atlas.  Europe = Atlas Mondial. Europe)
```
```
(Complete Works of Shakespeare.  Volume 3: Comedies = Œuvres Complètes de Shakespeare. Tome 3: Comédies)

```



## Relationships

Relationship to other ISBD elements:  This element is subordinate to the "Parallel title" (1.2) and related to "Common title" (1.1.3.7).  It is part of the larger "Title and Statement of Responsibility Area" (1).

Super-types/sub-types: N/A (as defined in ISBD)


## Stipulations

Special considerations: When both the title proper and its parallel title have dependent titles, ensure consistent use and placement of the dependent title designations in both titles.

Best practices: Transcribe the dependent title designation precisely as it appears on the resource. If there is no formal designation, one should not be constructed.


It is important to note this interpretation is based on the existing ISBD framework and logical deduction, as a specific stipulation for "dependent title designation of parallel title" is lacking in the document. This highlights a potential area for improvement and clarification in future ISBD updates.
