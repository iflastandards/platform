# has media type

The ISBD element "media type" (isbd:elements/P1003) is found within Area 0 of the ISBD: Content Form, Production Process and Media Type Area.  It is referred to as just "media type."

## Element Reference

- **Definition:** Media type categories record the type or types of carrier used to convey the content of the resource. Categories generally reflect the format of the storage medium and housing of a carrier in combination with the type of intermediation device required to render, view, run, etc., the content of a resource.
- **Domain:**  Bibliographic resources. More specifically, it applies to the *Manifestation* entity in the FRBR model.
- **Range:** Controlled vocabulary of media type terms (see below).
- **Element Type:** Mandatory.


## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element provides standardized terminology to describe the physical carrier of a resource and the type of device needed to access its content. This facilitates identification, selection, and retrieval of resources based on their physical format and access requirements. It promotes interoperability between systems and improves communication about the physical characteristics of resources.
- **User Tasks Supported:**
    - Identifying resources based on physical format.
    - Selecting resources appropriate to available playback or access devices.
    - Filtering search results based on media type.
    - Facilitating resource sharing and interlibrary loan.


## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:**  One or more terms from a controlled vocabulary (listed in section 0.2.2 of the ISBD) or their equivalents in the language chosen by the cataloguing agency should be given. For resources of mixed media with no predominant part, all applicable terms are recorded in alphabetical order. Exceptionally, if three or more media types are applicable, the term "multiple media" may be used. If one part of the resource is predominant and other media types are minimal, non-predominant types may be omitted. If no mediation device is required, "unmediated" is used.
- **Value Constraints and Formats:**  Terms should be taken from the controlled list or their equivalents. Multiple terms are separated by spaces.
- **String Encoding:** No specific encoding scheme is mentioned for the values themselves, but general principles for language and script of the description apply (see A.5).

## Examples

```
0.2.2 audio
0.2.2 electronic
0.2.2 microform
0.2.2 video
0.2.2 unmediated 
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** The media type is closely related to the "content form" and "production process" also found in Area 0. Together, these elements provide a comprehensive description of the resource's essence, creation, and embodiment.  It is also related to the "extent" in Area 5 (Material Description Area), which further specifies details about the physical unit.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** "multiple media" and "other media" act as super-types, allowing for more general categorization when needed.  The specific terms like "audio," "video," "electronic" act as sub-types.
- **Inverse Relationships:** None explicitly defined within ISBD.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  For older resources, the functions of publisher, printer, and distributor are often undifferentiated. Unless otherwise indicated, the publication, production, distribution information refers to any of these functions.
- **Exceptions:**  Minimal, non-predominant media types in mixed media resources may be omitted.
- **Best Practices:**  Use terms from the controlled vocabulary whenever possible for consistency and interoperability. When a term is not available in the controlled list, use the closest equivalent term and, if necessary, add a note explaining the choice. If no appropriate term can be found, use "other media." If no mediation device is required, use "unmediated." Always strive for clarity and accuracy in describing the media type.
