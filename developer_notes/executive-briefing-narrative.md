# IFLA Standards Development Platform: A Comprehensive Transformation Initiative

**Prepared for IFLA Leadership and Review Group Administrators**  
**January 2025**

## Introduction

The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) stands at a pivotal moment in its standards development journey. Through extensive research, prototyping, and analysis of current practices, we have developed a comprehensive evolution plan for the IFLA Standards Development Platform that builds upon existing successes while addressing critical workflow inefficiencies and positioning IFLA for sustainable, scalable standards development in the digital age.

This document presents the findings from our research and analysis, along with a detailed implementation strategy that promises to transform how IFLA develops, maintains, and publishes international library standards. The proposal represents not a replacement of current infrastructure, but rather a strategic enhancement that preserves what works while solving fundamental workflow challenges that have hindered efficiency and global collaboration.

## Current State: Building on a Solid Foundation

IFLA's current standards infrastructure at iflastandards.info demonstrates several architectural decisions that validate our proposed enhancement approach. The existing system successfully delivers linked open data through a namespace-based organization structure, serves a global audience reliably, and maintains proper oversight through IFLA's Advisory Committee on Standards (METATEC). These foundational strengths provide the stable base upon which our enhancements will build.

The current production system organizes five vocabularies—FRBR, ISBD, LRM, UNIMARC, and MulDiCat—in a logical namespace structure that aligns with IFLA's review group organization. This organizational model has proven effective and will be preserved and enhanced in our proposed system. The existing GitHub integration for technical content management provides version control capabilities that form the backbone of our expanded workflow approach.

However, our analysis reveals significant opportunities for enhancement that address fundamental workflow inefficiencies. The most transformational opportunity lies in evolving from the current document-centric workflow to an integrated web-first approach that eliminates disconnected processes and manual conversion steps that currently create bottlenecks and introduce errors.

## The Transformational Workflow Opportunity

The most significant enhancement opportunity we have identified involves addressing the fundamental disconnect between how IFLA standards are currently created and how they are ultimately published and used. Our research and prototyping work, particularly with the ISBDM site, has revealed a transformational model that addresses these core inefficiencies.

Under the current workflow, standards development follows a fragmented process where MS Word documents serve as the primary authoring environment, PDF files function as the distribution format, and RDF vocabularies are developed separately using hand-designed spreadsheets that require manual conversion to published formats. This approach creates several critical challenges: manual conversion introduces errors, updates require coordination across multiple disconnected systems, and the web presentation exists as a separate layer that may not accurately reflect the authoritative documents.

Our prototype work with ISBDM demonstrates a revolutionary alternative: a document-centric integration approach where spreadsheet-based vocabulary development automatically generates both comprehensive web documentation and properly formatted RDF outputs from a single authoritative source. This eliminates manual conversion steps, ensures consistency between formats, and enables real-time updates that propagate automatically across all output formats.

The implications of this transformation extend far beyond technical efficiency. By eliminating the disconnected workflows that currently require careful coordination and manual synchronization, standards developers can focus on content quality and accuracy rather than format management. The integrated approach ensures that documentation always matches the RDF vocabulary exactly, eliminating a significant source of errors and inconsistencies. Most importantly, changes propagate immediately to all formats and presentations, enabling more responsive standards development that can adapt quickly to community needs and feedback.

## Organizational Alignment and IFLA Structure

Our analysis confirms that IFLA's current namespace model provides an excellent foundation that aligns naturally with the organization's governance structure. The existing review group organization maps directly to namespace management, creating clear lines of authority and responsibility that can be enhanced through improved technical tools rather than reorganized.

The four primary review groups—International Cataloguing Principles (ICP), Bibliographic Conceptual Models (BCM), International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), and Permanent UNIMARC Committee (PUC)—each manage distinct namespace domains that reflect their subject matter expertise and governance authority. This organizational structure has proven effective and will be preserved while gaining enhanced technical capabilities for collaboration, review, and quality assurance.

Our proposed enhancement builds upon this proven organizational model by providing technical tools that make the existing governance structure more efficient and accessible. Rather than changing how IFLA operates, we are proposing to enhance how effectively IFLA can execute its established processes through better technical infrastructure and automated workflow support.

## Technical Architecture and Modern Capabilities

The proposed technical architecture represents a careful balance between innovation and reliability. We have designed a multi-type monorepo system that can support different types of applications and content while maintaining the simplicity and reliability that characterizes IFLA's current successful approach.

The architecture separates concerns appropriately: Docusaurus sites handle namespace documentation with their proven ability to manage complex technical documentation, Next.js applications provide modern administrative interfaces with sophisticated user interaction capabilities, and serverless edge functions handle data processing and API operations with automatic scaling and high reliability. This separation allows each component to excel in its specific domain while maintaining integration through well-defined interfaces.

The technology choices reflect a commitment to modern, well-supported tools that provide long-term sustainability. Docusaurus continues to be developed and enhanced by Facebook/Meta, ensuring continued support and improvement. Next.js represents the current state of the art in React-based web applications, with strong backing from Vercel and broad community adoption. The serverless approach eliminates infrastructure management overhead while providing automatic scaling and high availability.

Critical to the content management approach, TinaCMS provides direct page editing capabilities that allow content creators to make changes through an intuitive interface without requiring technical expertise. This visual editing approach transforms content management from a technical task into an accessible activity that can be performed by subject matter experts directly. Crowdin integration ensures that translation workflows are streamlined and consistent, providing professional translation management capabilities that maintain quality across multiple languages while enabling efficient collaboration between translators worldwide.

Perhaps most importantly, the architecture is designed to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The new system can coexist with current infrastructure during transition, provides backward compatibility for existing implementations, and offers clear migration paths that minimize disruption to ongoing work.

## Workflow Innovation and Global Collaboration

Beyond the technical infrastructure improvements, our proposal addresses fundamental challenges in how distributed teams collaborate on standards development. The current manual processes for review, approval, translation, and quality assurance create bottlenecks that limit IFLA's ability to respond quickly to community needs and engage global participation effectively.

Our workflow framework introduces structured collaboration tools that maintain IFLA's established authority relationships while providing modern collaboration capabilities. Review processes become integrated with content development rather than occurring as separate activities that require complex coordination. Translation workflows support consistency checking and terminology management across languages, ensuring that multilingual versions maintain accuracy and cultural appropriateness.

Quality assurance transforms from a manual activity prone to human error into an automated process that provides continuous validation and early error detection. This shifts quality management from reactive problem-solving to proactive prevention, improving both efficiency and final output quality.

The workflow improvements also address one of IFLA's most significant challenges: enabling meaningful participation from global community members who may not have deep technical expertise. By providing familiar interfaces built on the spreadsheet-based approaches that IFLA already uses successfully, we lower barriers to participation while enhancing capabilities.

## Implementation Strategy and Risk Management

Our implementation strategy prioritizes continuity and reliability over rapid transformation. The approach is designed to minimize risk through careful staging, comprehensive testing, and maintained parallel operations during transition periods.

The implementation strategy recognizes the critical importance of establishing the development environment correctly from the beginning. The first priority involves setting up the Nx workspace while maintaining all existing integrations, testing frameworks, and CI/CD patterns that currently ensure code quality and reliability. Simultaneously, ISBDM will be migrated as the first proof-of-concept, ensuring that the new architecture can successfully support the existing functionality that has been developed and validated.

The second critical priority focuses on implementing the complete spreadsheet-to-RDF pipeline in its final, production-ready form within the admin portal, complete with Vercel routing. This ensures that the core transformation workflow that represents the primary value proposition of the new system is functional and validated before proceeding with broader migration activities.

Risk management receives particular attention throughout the implementation. Technical risks are addressed through comprehensive backup procedures, extensive testing at each phase, and maintained rollback capabilities that allow quick recovery from any issues. Organizational risks are managed through careful change management, extensive training and support, and gradual rollout that allows users to adapt at a comfortable pace.

The parallel system approach ensures that current work can continue uninterrupted during the transition. Legacy URLs are preserved through automatic redirection, existing workflows continue to function during the migration period, and users can access content through both old and new interfaces until the transition is complete.

## Expected Outcomes and Strategic Benefits

The expected outcomes from this transformation extend across technical, operational, and strategic dimensions. From a technical perspective, the new system will provide significantly improved performance, reliability, and capability while reducing infrastructure costs and maintenance overhead. The automated quality assurance and validation systems will dramatically reduce errors and inconsistencies that currently require manual correction.

Operationally, the integrated workflows will reduce the time required for common content management tasks by approximately fifty percent while improving the quality and consistency of outputs. The enhanced collaboration tools will enable more effective participation from global IFLA membership, potentially increasing both the quantity and quality of community contributions to standards development.

Strategically, the enhanced platform positions IFLA as a leader in modern standards development practices. The combination of technical excellence, workflow efficiency, and global accessibility demonstrates IFLA's commitment to serving the international library community through innovative approaches that respect established governance while embracing modern capabilities.

The transformation also provides a scalable foundation for future growth and innovation. The platform architecture can accommodate new namespaces, additional languages, and emerging technologies without requiring fundamental restructuring. This ensures that the investment in platform enhancement will continue to provide value as IFLA's needs evolve.

## Financial Considerations and Return on Investment

The financial analysis of this enhancement initiative reveals a compelling return on investment that justifies the development costs through operational savings, quality improvements, and strategic value creation. The primary financial benefits derive from the elimination of manual processes that currently require significant staff time and the reduction of errors that necessitate costly correction activities.

The automated workflow processes will reduce the time required for content management activities by approximately fifty percent, freeing staff to focus on higher-value activities like content development and community engagement. The integrated translation workflows will improve translation efficiency while enhancing quality, reducing both the time and cost associated with multilingual content development.

Infrastructure costs will decrease through the adoption of modern hosting and deployment approaches that eliminate manual server management while providing better performance and reliability. The serverless architecture automatically scales to meet demand while minimizing costs during periods of lower usage.

Perhaps most importantly, the quality improvements will reduce the long-term costs associated with error correction, content updates, and stakeholder communication around content issues. By catching errors early in the development process and ensuring consistency across all output formats, the system reduces the downstream costs that currently result from manual processes and disconnected workflows.

## Global Impact and Community Benefits

The enhanced platform will provide immediate benefits to IFLA's global community through improved accessibility, enhanced multilingual support, and more effective collaboration capabilities. The web-first approach ensures that standards are accessible to users regardless of their technical sophistication or access to specialized software.

The integrated multilingual capabilities will significantly improve IFLA's ability to serve its global membership. Rather than treating translation as a separate activity that occurs after English content is finalized, the new system integrates multilingual development into the core workflow, enabling more timely and accurate translations that better serve non-English speaking communities.

The enhanced collaboration tools will enable more effective participation from library professionals worldwide, regardless of their geographic location or technical expertise. The familiar spreadsheet-based interfaces combined with modern collaboration features will lower barriers to participation while providing sophisticated capabilities for those who need them.

The improved quality assurance and consistency checking will ensure that IFLA standards maintain the highest levels of accuracy and reliability, enhancing IFLA's reputation as a source of authoritative guidance for the international library community.
