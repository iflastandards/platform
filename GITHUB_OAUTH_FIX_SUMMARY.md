# GitHub OAuth Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The "Login with GitHub" button on `http://localhost:3000/admin` was launching another login screen instead of properly authenticating with GitHub OAuth. This was causing authentication failures and preventing users from accessing the admin interface.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **duplicate middleware files** in the admin portal that created a conflict:

1. **Primary middleware**: `/apps/admin/middleware.ts` (used by Next.js)
   - Handled authentication and routing logic
   - **Missing CORS configuration**

2. **Secondary middleware**: `/apps/admin/src/middleware.ts` (ignored by Next.js)
   - Contained proper CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
   - Never executed because Next.js only uses root-level middleware

## Authentication Flow
The intended flow is:
1. User visits `http://localhost:3000/admin` (portal admin page)
2. `useAdminSession` hook checks authentication via `http://localhost:3007/services/api/auth/session`
3. If not authenticated, `LoginPrompt` redirects to `http://localhost:3007/services/auth/signin`
4. NextAuth handles GitHub OAuth authentication
5. User is redirected back to portal admin with valid session

## The Problem
Without proper CORS headers, the portal at `localhost:3000` couldn't communicate with the admin portal at `localhost:3007`, causing:
- Session checks to fail
- Authentication state to remain "loading" or "unauthenticated"
- Users to see repeated login screens

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Merged Middleware Files
Combined both middleware files into a single `/apps/admin/middleware.ts` that includes:
- **CORS handling** for API and auth routes
- **Authentication logic** for dashboard redirects
- **Mock authentication** support for development

### 2. CORS Configuration
Added proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests:
```javascript
// Allowed origins for CORS - Only portal needs access
const allowedOrigins = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? ['https://www.iflastandards.info'] // Production portal
  : process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'preview' || process.env.GITHUB_PAGES === 'true'
  ? ['https://iflastandards.github.io'] // Preview environment
  : ['http://localhost:3000']; // Development portal only
```

### 3. Updated Middleware Matcher
Extended the middleware to handle all necessary routes:
```javascript
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/auth/:path*', '/api/:path*'],
};
```

## Files Modified
- âœ… **Fixed**: `/apps/admin/middleware.ts` - Merged CORS and auth logic
- âœ… **Removed**: `/apps/admin/src/middleware.ts` - Eliminated duplicate

## Next Steps to Complete the Fix

### 1. Restart Admin Portal
The middleware changes require a restart to take effect:

```bash
# Stop current admin portal (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
# Then restart with:
nx dev admin-portal
# OR
pnpm start:admin-portal
```

### 2. Verify the Fix
Run the test script to confirm CORS headers are working:
```bash
node test_cors_fix.js
```

You should see:
```
âœ“ Access-Control-Allow-Origin header: PRESENT
âœ“ Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header: PRESENT
ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS: CORS headers are properly configured!
```

### 3. Test Authentication Flow
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/admin` in your browser
2. Click "Login with GitHub"
3. You should be redirected to GitHub OAuth (not another login screen)
4. After GitHub authentication, you should be redirected back to the portal admin

## Expected Outcome
After restarting the admin portal, the GitHub OAuth authentication should work correctly:
- âœ… No more repeated login screens
- âœ… Proper redirect to GitHub OAuth
- âœ… Successful authentication and return to portal admin
- âœ… Session persistence across browser tabs/refreshes

## Technical Details
- **Environment**: Local development (`localhost:3000` â†” `localhost:3007`)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with GitHub provider
- **CORS**: Cross-origin requests between portal and admin portal
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with role-based access control

The fix ensures that the portal can properly communicate with the admin portal's authentication endpoints, resolving the GitHub OAuth authentication issue.
