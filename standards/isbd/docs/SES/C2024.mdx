# Parallel Title (Compound) Of Series Or Multipart Monographic Resource Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This refers to a **parallel title** for a series or multipart monographic resource that is also structured with a **common title and a dependent title**. It is an equivalent of a compound series title proper in another language or script [6.2.2, 482].
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
- **Parallel common title (Optional):** The equivalent of the series common title in another language or script [6.2.2].
- **Parallel dependent title (Optional):** The equivalent of the series dependent title in another language or script [6.2.2].

</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
- The **entire parallel title statement** (including its compound parts) is preceded by **=**.
- The dependent part follows the common part, generally separated by a **point (.)** [484, example from 1.2.5.5].
- The **entire series statement** is enclosed in **parentheses ( )**.

</div>

## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
This is element **6.2.2** within the Series and Multipart Monographic Resource Area (Area 6). It applies the compound title structure to parallel series titles.
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
- It is a form within the "Series And Multipart Monographic Resource Area Encoding Scheme."
- It is analogous to the "Compound Title Of Parallel Title Encoding Scheme" (1.2.5.5) but applied to the series level.

</div>

## Examples

<div className="stip">
- **(Sounds of the theatre. Music = Voci del teatro. La musica)**
- **(中国动物志. 昆虫纲. 第四十六卷, 膜翅目. 茧蜂科(四). 窄径茧蜂亚科 = Fauna sinica. Insecta. Vol. 46, Hymenoptera. Braconidae (IV). Agathidinae)** (This example from Area 1 illustrates the compound parallel title structure, which is applied to series as well).

</div>
