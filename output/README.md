# Output Directory

This directory contains output files that we wish to keep, organized by purpose for easy retrieval. These files are tracked by git and represent important project artifacts.

## Directory Structure

- **spreadsheet outputs**: Generated Excel (.xlsx) and CSV files from the spreadsheet API
- **isbd-sheets/**: ISBD vocabulary CSV files organized by workbook
- **{project}-spreadsheets/**: Excel workbooks generated by spreadsheet-api.ts
- **link-validation/**: Results from link validation processes
- **ISBDM-Directory-spreadsheets/**: ISBDM directory-related spreadsheet outputs
- **ISBDM-spreadsheets/**: ISBDM standard spreadsheet outputs
- **isbd-excel-proper/**: Properly formatted ISBD Excel files

## File Organization Strategy

Files in this directory are organized by purpose and type for easy retrieval. This follows the project's output management strategy:
- **Output we wish to keep** → `output/` folder (this directory)
- **Output we don't wish to keep** → `tmp/` folder (auto-cleaned nightly, not tracked by git)

## Regeneration Instructions

While these files are preserved in git, they can be regenerated if needed:

### Spreadsheets
```bash
# Generate Excel workbooks
pnpm dlx tsx scripts/spreadsheet-api.ts excel PROJECT_NAME profile

# Generate Google Sheets
pnpm dlx tsx scripts/spreadsheet-api.ts google PROJECT_NAME profile
```

### ISBD Excel Files
```bash
pnpm dlx tsx scripts/create-proper-isbd-excel.ts
```

All generated files are based on source CSV data in the standards directories.
