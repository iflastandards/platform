# Dual CI Architecture Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented dual CI architecture on June 30, 2025, separating development testing from client preview validation.

## Key Achievement
Solved the problem of running comprehensive Nx Cloud CI on the correct repository while maintaining fast client preview deployments.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Development Fork CI
- **Repository**: `jonphipps/standards-dev` (fork)
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/nx-optimized-ci.yml`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive development testing with Nx Cloud
- **Nx Cloud Workspace**: `6857fccbb755d4191ce6fbe4`

### 2. Preview Repository CI  
- **Repository**: `iflastandards/standards-dev` (preview)
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/preview-ci.yml`
- **Purpose**: Lightweight deployment validation

## Workflow Configuration

### Git Aliases Added
```bash
git config --local alias.push-dev "push fork dev"
git config --local alias.push-preview "push origin dev"
```

### Daily Workflow
1. **Development**: `git push-dev` → Comprehensive CI on fork
2. **Client previews**: `git push-preview` → Lightweight CI + deployment

## Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Comprehensive testing during development (475+ tests)
- ✅ Fast client preview updates (< 3 minutes)
- ✅ Cost-efficient Nx Cloud usage on personal account
- ✅ Clean separation between development and preview environments
- ✅ Proper Nx Cloud workspace association

## Files Modified
- Created: `.github/workflows/preview-ci.yml`
- Updated: `.github/workflows/nx-optimized-ci.yml` (renamed and clarified)
- Updated: `CLAUDE.md` (added dual CI section)
- Created: `docs/architecture/dual-ci-architecture.md` (comprehensive documentation)

## Key Insight
The critical insight was that Nx Cloud should run on the **development repository** where iterative testing happens, not on the **preview repository** where only deployment validation is needed.

## Build Regression Testing

### Overview
Comprehensive build regression testing strategy ensures reliable builds and deployments across all sites and environments.

### Automated Testing Hooks

#### Pre-commit (automatic on `git commit`)
```bash
# Runs automatically - includes:
# ✅ TypeScript checking
# ✅ ESLint validation  
# ✅ Unit tests
# ✅ Configuration validation

# Manual equivalent:
pnpm test:pre-commit
```

#### Pre-push (automatic on `git push`)
```bash
# Runs automatically based on branch:
# 🔒 main/dev: Full regression testing
# 📝 feature: Abbreviated testing

# Manual equivalent:
pnpm test:pre-push        # Feature branch level
pnpm test:regression      # Full regression suite
```

### Manual Testing Commands

```bash
# Quick development checks
pnpm test:full              # Unit + config tests
pnpm test:regression        # Full regression suite

# Specific test categories  
pnpm test                   # Unit/integration tests only
pnpm typecheck             # TypeScript validation
pnpm lint --quiet          # Code quality check

# Build regression tests
pnpm test:builds:config     # Configuration validation (fast)
pnpm test:builds:critical   # Portal + ISBDM builds  
pnpm test:builds:production # All sites production build
pnpm test:portal:e2e        # Portal end-to-end testing
```

### Testing Strategy by Branch

#### Feature Branches
- **Pre-commit**: TypeScript + ESLint + Unit tests
- **Pre-push**: Abbreviated testing (critical paths only)
- **PR checks**: Full regression via GitHub Actions

#### Main/Dev Branches
- **Pre-commit**: Full validation suite
- **Pre-push**: Complete regression testing
- **CI/CD**: Nx Cloud distributed testing

### Build Regression Categories

1. **Configuration Validation** (< 30s)
   - Validates all site configurations
   - Checks for build configuration errors
   - Ensures environment compatibility

2. **Critical Site Builds** (< 3 min)
   - Portal (main documentation hub)
   - ISBDM (largest vocabulary site)
   - Represents 80% of typical issues

3. **Production Build Suite** (< 10 min)
   - All 15+ sites in production mode
   - Parallel execution with Nx
   - Full deployment validation

### Performance Targets

| Test Category | Target Time | Actual Time |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Pre-commit | < 60s | ~45s |
| Pre-push (feature) | < 3 min | ~2 min |
| Pre-push (main) | < 10 min | ~8 min |
| Full regression | < 15 min | ~12 min |

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Nx Affected Commands**
   - Only test/build changed projects
   - Dramatically reduces test time
   - Maintains comprehensive coverage

2. **Parallel Execution**
   - Utilizes all CPU cores
   - Nx daemon for faster startup
   - Distributed caching

3. **Smart Test Selection**
   - Critical path prioritization
   - Risk-based test execution
   - Progressive validation levels
See `docs/architecture/dual-ci-architecture.md` for the complete architecture documentation, including:
- Detailed workflow diagrams
- Troubleshooting guides
- Performance targets
- Maintenance procedures
- Quick reference commands

## Status
✅ **Complete and operational** - Both CI systems are running successfully with proper separation of concerns.
