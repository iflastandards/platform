## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element identifies the agents responsible for the intellectual or artistic content represented by the title. It clarifies the role of the agent in relation to the work. It distinguishes contributions directly related to the creation of the work (author, composer, artist) from those related to its subsequent realization or presentation (editor, translator, performer). Including this information helps users understand the nature of the resource and the relationship of the named agent(s) to it.
- **User Tasks Supported:**
    - Identifying the creators or originators of the work.
    - Distinguishing between different editions or versions of a work based on differences in responsibility statements.
    - Searching and retrieving resources based on the names of creators or contributors.

## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** The statement should be transcribed exactly as it appears on the preferred source of information for the title.  Abbreviations common in statements of responsibility may be used (e.g., ed., comp., trans.). For older resources and manuscripts, degrees or positions held by the agents are included only if essential to the understanding of the statement.  Otherwise, this information is omitted or relegated to a note.
- **Value Constraints and Formats:** No specific format is prescribed beyond transcribing the statement as it appears on the source.  However, ISBD general principles for transcription apply (e.g., capitalization, punctuation, treatment of abbreviations).
- **String Encoding Scheme:** UTF-8 is recommended.

## Examples

```
Beethoven's piano sonatas / Ludwig van Beethoven.
```

```
Macbeth / William Shakespeare ; edited by David Bevington.
```

```
The collected works of Jane Austen / edited by J. David Grey.
```

```
The French Revolution : a history / Thomas Carlyle ; abridged and with an introduction by K.J. Fielding.
```
```
星空の下のソナタ = Sonata under the stars / by Alexia Spring ; translated from the French by Emily Carter. 
```


## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** This element is most closely related to the title proper and other title information. It may also be related to statements of responsibility in the Edition area when a specific edition is attributed to a particular editor, reviser, etc.
- **Super-types/Sub-types:** The "statement of responsibility" is a general element, and this can be considered a sub-type that applies specifically to statements of responsibility linked to the title.
- **Inverse Relationships:** None specified.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** When a statement of responsibility is grammatically or typographically linked to the title, it is included as part of the title proper or other title information and is not repeated as a separate statement of responsibility. If the statement applies to the whole resource but appears before the title proper on the preferred source of information, it should be transcribed after the title unless linguistically linked.  For older resources, degrees and positions held should only be included if considered part of the title proper according to older bibliographic conventions. 
- **Best Practices:** It is important to carefully examine the typographical presentation of the statement of responsibility on the source to determine whether it should be treated as integral to the title or as a separate statement of responsibility.  Clarity and consistency in applying this principle are essential.
