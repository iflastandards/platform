# has parallel title

The ISBD element "parallel title" is found within the PDF document.  Here's a breakdown of the element according to your requested structure:

## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD Definition:** A parallel title consists of a title in another language or script than the title proper and presented as an equivalent of the title proper on the preferred source or sources of information. A title in another language that is linguistically linked to another part of the description is not treated as a parallel title. (Section 1.2.1)
- **Domain:**  Monographic resources, Serials, Multipart monographic resources. Essentially any resource with a title proper can also have a parallel title.
- **Range:** A string representing a title in a different language or script.
- **Element Type:**  Descriptive


## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** To provide the title of the resource in another language or script, aiding in international exchange and retrieval of bibliographic information and enabling users to identify resources irrespective of language knowledge.
- **User Tasks Supported:** Resource discovery and identification across language barriers. Facilitates multilingual searching in catalogs and databases.


## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** Transcribe exactly as to wording, but not necessarily as to capitalization and punctuation. (1.2.5.1)  If multiple parallel titles exist, transcribe in the order indicated by typography or sequence of statements on the prescribed source. (1.2.5.2)  May be abridged, following the rules for abridging title proper. (1.2.5.2)
- **Value Constraints and Formats:** Must be a title equivalent to the title proper.  Should be taken directly from the resource.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  Follows the language and script of the parallel title itself (A.5). Can involve transliteration if the script isn't readily available (A.5).



## Examples

```
= Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde
```

```
= Le Cahier des arts
```

```
= 世界地图集
```

```
=  Das Lied von der Erde
```

```
=  Les Misérables
```


## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** Closely related to the "title proper" element, serving as its equivalent in a different language or script.  Can be associated with statements of responsibility and other title information if linguistically linked. (1.2.5.1)
- **Super-types and Sub-types:**  No specific sub-types defined in the current ISBD standard.  Could be considered a sub-type of a broader "title" element.
- **Inverse Relationships:**  None explicitly defined.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  A title in another language linked to another descriptive element (like a statement of responsibility) is *not* a parallel title.  (1.2.1)   Information about the edition of the work translated can be part of the parallel title if linguistically integrated. (1.4.3.4)
- **Exceptions:**  For tête-bêche publications, the title not selected as title proper becomes the parallel title. (1.2.3)
- **Best Practices:**  Clearly separate parallel titles with the prescribed punctuation (`=`). Indicate the source of the parallel title if it's not from the preferred source of information. (1.2.5.3)  Use transliteration for scripts not readily available, ensuring consistency in how this is applied. (A.5)
