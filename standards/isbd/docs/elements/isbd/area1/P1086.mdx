# has note on parallel titles and parallel other title information

The ISBD element "note on parallel titles and parallel other title information" is found within Section 7.1.3 of the ISBD documentation.


## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD Definition:**  Parallel titles and parallel other title information may be given in a note when they are not recorded in area 1.
- **Domain:**  Bibliographic resources that have parallel titles or parallel other title information not recorded in Area 1 (Title and Statement of Responsibility Area).
- **Range:**  Textual note providing the parallel title(s) or parallel other title information.
- **Element Type:** Descriptive.

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element allows catalogers to record parallel titles and other title information that appear on the resource but are not transcribed in Area 1 due to the selection rules for title proper.  This ensures that all title information deemed important is captured in the record, aiding in resource discovery and identification, especially for multilingual or multiscript resources.
- **User Tasks Supported:** Enhanced resource discovery, disambiguation of resources with similar main titles, understanding the scope and content of multilingual resources.

## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:** Transcribe the parallel title or other title information following the conventions for Area 1 (including transcription of statements of responsibility or other descriptive elements linguistically linked to the parallel title). Use square brackets to enclose information taken from sources other than those prescribed for Area 1 or when supplying information.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:**  Follow the same transcription rules as for Area 1, including the prescribed punctuation for parallel titles (`=`) and other title information (`:`) where applicable within the note.
- **String Encoding Schemes:** As with other text elements in ISBD, Unicode is recommended for ensuring proper representation of characters from various scripts.

## Examples

```
Note: Issues for July/Aug. 1962-Sept./Oct. 1966 have title also in Chinese: Wen hua
```

```
Note: French title from title screen: Les techniques de la prévision à court terme
Title on added title page: Introduction à la langue française
```

```
Note: Title in Russian on container:  Основы квантовой механики
```

```
Note: Other title information in German from dust jacket:  Eine Einführung
```

```
Note:  Parallel title on CD label:  Konzert für Violine und Orchester
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** This element is directly related to Area 1 (Title and Statement of Responsibility Area) and clarifies or supplements the information provided there. It is placed in Area 7 (Note Area) because it provides additional information not captured in the formal areas of the description.
- **Super-types/Sub-types:** This element can be considered a sub-type of "note related to title and statement of responsibility".
- **Inverse Relationships:** None.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** For serials and multipart monographs, if parallel title or parallel other title information appears on later parts and is deemed important, it can be recorded in a note along with the numbering of the relevant issues or parts.
- **Exceptions:**  Information that is linguistically linked to other parts of the description (e.g., as an alternative title or part of a statement of responsibility) is not treated as a parallel title or parallel other title information and should be recorded in the appropriate area.
- **Best Practices:** Be consistent in the application of transcription rules and punctuation. When in doubt, provide more information rather than less, to ensure clarity and facilitate resource identification.  Clearly indicate the source of the information if it's not from the prescribed sources for Area 1.
