# has statement of coordinates and equinox

The element "statement of coordinates and equinox" is found within the larger "Mathematical data" area (Area 3.1) which is specifically for cartographic resources.  The elements *statement of coordinates* and *statement of equinox* are treated separately, although closely related.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:**  These elements provide the geographic boundaries of the area depicted on a map and the equinox (celestial reference point) to which those coordinates are aligned.  This allows for precise identification of the map's coverage and its relationship to celestial positioning systems, especially important for astronomical maps and charts where precession (the slow change in the orientation of Earth's rotational axis) affects coordinate accuracy over time.

- **User Tasks Supported:** Locating resources geographically, understanding the spatial extent of the map's content, determining the celestial reference frame for astronomical charts.


## Element Values

**Statement of Coordinates:**

- **Rules/Guidelines:** Terrestrial coordinates are presented as westernmost/easternmost longitude then northernmost/southernmost latitude. Longitude and latitude are expressed in degrees (°), minutes, and seconds (") of the sexagesimal system. The geographic coordinate system or meridian of reference is specified if not the Greenwich meridian. Coordinates may also be recorded as decimal degrees. Celestial coordinates (Right ascension and declination) are presented using hours, minutes, and seconds for right ascension, and degrees, minutes, and seconds with a plus (+) or minus (-) sign for declination, indicating the celestial hemisphere. (3.1.3.1.1, 3.1.3.1.3). Non-terrestrial coordinates are presented using decimal degrees and the coordinate system name. (3.1.3.1.2)

- **Formats:**  (W xxx°xx'xx"–W xxx°xx'xx"/N xxx°xx'xx"–S xxx°xx'xx", Reference Meridian) or (decimal degrees, coordinate system name), (RA xx h xx min xx s/Decl. +/-xx°xx'xx"; Celestial Hemisphere).

- **String Encoding:**  UTF-8 is recommended.

**Statement of Equinox:**

- **Rules/Guidelines:** The equinox is expressed as a four-digit year, optionally followed by a decimal number representing the month. Preceded by "equinox" or its equivalent.

- **Formats:** `; equinox yyyy.m`




## Examples

**Statement of Coordinates (Terrestrial):**

```
(W 74°50'–W 74°40'/N 45°5′-N 45°00')
(W 78°42'--W 70°45'/N 22°48'--N 19°06', Cadiz meridian) 
(W 95.15°-W 74.35°/N 56.85°-N 41.73°, selenographic coordinate system)
```

**Statement of Coordinates (Celestial):**

```
(RA 16 h 30 min to 19 h 30 min/Decl. -16° to -49°)
```

**Statement of Equinox:**

```
; epoch 1948, equinox 1950
; equinox 1860.0
```


## Relationships

- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:** These elements are part of Area 3.1, *Mathematical data*, within the larger *Material or type of resource specific area* (Area 3).  They are directly related to the *Statement of Projection* and *Statement of Scale*, providing a comprehensive description of the map's spatial attributes.  Further clarifications or details not fitting the prescribed format may be provided in notes in Area 7.

- **Sub-types:** Terrestrial coordinates, Celestial coordinates (right ascension and declination), Non-terrestrial coordinates.



## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  If a scale is not given, coordinates should still be provided if known.  The level of detail (degrees, minutes, seconds) should be appropriate to the scale of the map.  For digital cartographic resources, further notes may be necessary to describe data type, object type, resolution, etc. (7.3.1.3)

- **Best Practices:** Use standard abbreviations and formats for consistency. If coordinates are obtained from a source other than the resource itself, this should be noted in Area 7. Clarify any unusual coordinate systems or reference meridians in notes.  For astronomical maps, always specify the equinox.
