# has note on system requirements

The ISBD element "note on system requirements" is found within Section 7.0.3, "System Requirements" of the provided PDF.  It is not explicitly defined as a separate element in the way that "title" or "edition" are, but rather is a type of note within the broader Note Area (Area 7).

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** The element clarifies the technical specifications necessary to access and utilize an electronic resource, aiding users in determining compatibility with their available hardware and software. This is crucial for digital resources where access is dependent on specific technical configurations.
- **User Tasks Supported:** Helps users assess the resource's accessibility, aiding in resource discovery and selection. Allows users to filter resources based on their technical capabilities.  Informs resource management decisions regarding software and hardware requirements within libraries and archives.

## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:**  The note should include, as applicable and in order: Name and model/number of machine(s); Amount of memory; Operating System(s); Software requirements (including programming language); Peripherals; Hardware modifications; Character code. Each requirement after the first is preceded by a semicolon.
- **Value Constraints and Formats:** Should be factual and descriptive, avoiding evaluative language.  Uses standard abbreviations when possible (see Appendix D).
- **String Encoding Schemes:** Not specified in the context of this note, but overall character encoding might be mentioned as part of the system requirements themselves.


## Examples

```
Note: System requirements: Macintosh; at least 1 MB; System 6.0.5 or later; HyperCard version 1.0 or later; hard disk drive; videodisc player (Pioneer 2200, 4200, 6000A, 6010A, 8000); RS232 cable connector (from Macintosh to videodisc player)
```

```
Note: System requirements: 386SX processor or higher; 2 MB RAM (4 MB recommended); Windows 3.0 or higher; hard disk with 8 MB free space; VGA adapter; color monitor; mouse
```

```
Note: System requirements: Philips Interactive compact disc (CD-I) player with monitor
```

```
Note: System Requirements: Minimum 4GB RAM; Android OS 7.0 or higher
```

```
Note: System requirements: Internet connection; Adobe Flash Player
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD Elements:** Relates to the resource described as a whole.  Can be linked to Area 0 (Content Form, Production Process and Media Type Area) and Area 5 (Material Description Area), which might provide contextual information about the format or physical carrier of the electronic resource. Specifically related to Mode of Access (7.0.4), which often follows system requirements.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:**  This element can be considered a sub-type of "Note" (Area 7).  It doesn't have further sub-types specified in the ISBD.
- **Inverse Relationships:** None specified.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** When the resource consists of multiple physical carriers, a separate system requirements note can be created for each carrier, or a single note can cover all if appropriate.  If no information is available, the note should state "System requirements: No information available".
- **Best Practices:** Be as specific as possible with system requirements to ensure clarity and aid users in determining accessibility.  Use standard terminology and abbreviations for consistency. Where possible, provide the minimum requirements as well as recommended specifications. Keep the note concise and factual. It is important to remember this applies specifically to *direct access* electronic resources.  For *remote access* electronic resources, this information is not relevant.
