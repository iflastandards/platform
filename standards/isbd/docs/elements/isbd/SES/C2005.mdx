# Edition Area Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This area (Area 2) records information about the <strong>edition, drafting, version, etc.</strong>, of a resource. For unpublished resources, it can specify the stage of the production process for pre-publication materials, the state of a drafting, or the version of a file.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Edition, drafting, version, etc. statement (Mandatory if available):</strong> Usually includes the word "edition" (or equivalent) with a number (e.g., "2nd ed."), or a term indicating difference (e.g., "new edition," "revised version," "first draft," "release 0.5").</li>
  <li><strong>Parallel edition, drafting, version, etc. statement (Optional):</strong> An equivalent edition statement in another language or script.</li>
  <li><strong>Statement of responsibility relating to the edition, drafting, version, etc. (Mandatory if available):</strong> Refers to persons or corporate bodies responsible for the specific edition, such as revisers or those providing supplementary matter within that edition.</li>
  <li><strong>Additional edition, drafting, version, etc. statement (Mandatory if available):</strong> A formal statement identifying the resource as belonging to an impression within an edition, or an edition equivalent to the first-named edition, especially if it has significant content differences from other impressions.</li>
  <li><strong>Statement of responsibility relating to an additional edition, drafting, version, etc. statement (Mandatory if available):</strong> Responsibilities related to the additional edition statement.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
<ul>
  <li>Each <strong>parallel edition, drafting, version, etc. statement</strong> is preceded by <strong>=</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>first statement of responsibility</strong> (related to the edition or following an additional statement) is preceded by <strong>/</strong>.</li>
  <li>Each <strong>subsequent statement of responsibility</strong> is preceded by <strong>;</strong> (unless statements form a single phrase).</li>
  <li>An <strong>additional edition, drafting, version, etc. statement</strong> is preceded by <strong>,</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
<ul>
  <li>Information related to the production process (e.g., master, matrix) is transcribed in the <strong>Material or Type of Resource Specific Area (Area 3)</strong>, not here.</li>
  <li>Edition statements that are an integral part of the title proper or other title information are recorded in the <strong>Title and Statement of Responsibility Area (Area 1)</strong> and not repeated here.</li>
  <li>Changes in edition statements for serials or integrating resources may require a new description or be noted in the <strong>Note Area (Area 7)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
