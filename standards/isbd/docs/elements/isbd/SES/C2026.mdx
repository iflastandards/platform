# Content Form And Media Type Statement Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This refers to the <strong>combined, formatted statement</strong> of the content form(s), production process (if applicable), and media type(s) that forms the core description within <strong>Area 0 (Content Form, Production Process and Media Type Area)</strong>. It provides an immediate overview of what the resource contains and on what physical carrier it exists.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
It combines the elements from Area 0:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Content form:</strong> (Mandatory) The fundamental form (e.g., "Text," "Image," "Dataset").</li>
  <li><strong>Content qualification:</strong> (Mandatory if applicable) Specific attributes (e.g., "(visual)", "(cartographic ; still ; 2-dimensional)").</li>
  <li><strong>Production process:</strong> (Optional) Method of fixation and production (e.g., "handwriting," "burning").</li>
  <li><strong>Production process qualification:</strong> (Optional) Status of production (e.g., "(unpublished)").</li>
  <li><strong>Media type:</strong> (Mandatory) Type of carrier (e.g., "electronic," "unmediated," "video").</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
The punctuation patterns define how these elements are combined:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Content form (content qualification) : production process (production process qualification) ; media type</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Content form (content qualification ; content qualification) : media type</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Content form. Content form (content qualification) : media type</strong> (for different content forms in one media type).</li>
  <li><strong>Content form (content qualification) : production process ; media type + Content form (content qualification) : production process (production process qualification) ; media type</strong> (for different media types, content forms, and production processes).</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
This is the primary output of <strong>Area 0</strong>, explicitly detailing its structured nature. It was a significant development in the 2011 consolidated edition to provide greater specificity.
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
It integrates the "Content Form," "Production Process," and "Media Type" elements (which themselves could be considered mini-SES) into a coherent statement. It's the practical application of the "Content Form And Media Type Area Encoding Scheme."
</div>

## Examples

<div className="stip">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dataset : electronic</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Text (visual) : handwriting (unpublished) ; unmediated</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Image (cartographic ; still ; 2-dimensional ; visual) : unmediated</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Text (visual) : unmediated + Text (visual) : microform</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
