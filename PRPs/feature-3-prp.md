# PRP: standards-dev - API Development

## Goal

Implement API Development for standards-dev

## Why


- Detected from project analysis: API Development

- Provide value to end users

- Establish foundation for future features

## What

IFLA Standards Platform

### Success Criteria


- [ ] API Development is fully functional

- [ ] Frontend Components is fully functional

- [ ] Testing Framework is fully functional

- [ ] Type Safety is fully functional

- [ ] Styling System is fully functional

## All Needed Context

### Documentation & References

```yaml
# MUST READ - Include these in your context window
- url: https://nextjs.org/docs
  why: Next.js 15 documentation for App Router and Server Components
```

### Current Codebase Structure

```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── lib/
│   └── types/
├── public/
├── tests/
└── package.json
```

### Desired Codebase Structure

```
project-root/
├── src/
```

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks

```typescript
# CRITICAL: Next.js 15 requires &quot;use client&quot; directive for interactive components
# CRITICAL: Server Components cannot use browser APIs or event handlers
# CRITICAL: Use RS256 algorithm for production JWT tokens, not HS256
# CRITICAL: Store refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies for security
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Data Models and Structure

Define the core data models to ensure type safety and consistency:

```typescript
# TODO: Add data models based on requirements
```


### Task Breakdown

```yaml
Task 0: Set up project foundation
CREATE project structure:
  - Initialize project with package manager
  - Set up TypeScript/language configuration
  - Configure linting and formatting
  - Set up testing framework

Task 1: Implement API Development
CREATE features/detected-0:
  - Implement API Development functionality

Task 2: Implement Frontend Components
CREATE features/detected-1:
  - Implement Frontend Components functionality

Task 3: Implement Testing Framework
CREATE features/detected-2:
  - Implement Testing Framework functionality

Task 4: Implement Type Safety
CREATE features/detected-3:
  - Implement Type Safety functionality

Task 5: Implement Styling System
CREATE features/detected-4:
  - Implement Styling System functionality

```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax & Style

```bash
# Run these FIRST - fix any errors before proceeding
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run type-check
npm run type-check

# Expected: No errors. If errors, READ the error and fix.
```

### Level 2: Unit Tests

```typescript
# Test cases to implement:
```

```bash
# Run and iterate until passing:
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Level 3: Integration Test

```bash
# Start the service
npm run dev

# Test the endpoint

# Expected: All tests passing, feature working as expected
```

### Level 4: Deployment & Creative Validation

```bash
# npm run build # Build production version
# Run integration tests against staging
# Deploy to staging environment
# Run smoke tests on staging
# Deploy to production with rollback plan
# npm audit # Security scan
# next-secure-headers --check # Security scan

# Custom validation specific to this feature:
# - Load testing with realistic data
# - End-to-end user journey testing
# - Performance benchmarking
# - Security scanning
```

## Final Validation Checklist


- [ ] All tests pass

- [ ] No linting errors

- [ ] No type errors

- [ ] Manual test successful

- [ ] Error cases handled gracefully

- [ ] Logs are informative but not verbose

- [ ] UI is responsive on mobile

- [ ] Accessibility requirements met

- [ ] API endpoints return correct status codes

- [ ] Input validation is comprehensive

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid


- ❌ Don&#x27;t create new patterns when existing ones work

- ❌ Don&#x27;t skip validation because &#x27;it should work&#x27;

- ❌ Don&#x27;t ignore failing tests - fix them

- ❌ Don&#x27;t hardcode values that should be config

- ❌ Don&#x27;t catch all exceptions - be specific

- ❌ Don&#x27;t use client components for static content

- ❌ Don&#x27;t fetch data in client components when server components can do it
