# has work aspect

The element "work aspect" (isbd:elements/P1193) is **not** explicitly defined in the provided ISBD documentation.  The ISBD standard focuses on describing the *manifestation* of a resource,  not the abstract *work* itself. While the linked RDF ontology *might* define "work aspect," the ISBD document supplied doesn't address characteristics at the work level such as subject matter, genre, or intended audience. These are handled through access points and subject indexing, which are outside the scope of the ISBD (as stated in section A.1.3).  Area 7 (Notes) *could* contain information related to the work, but those notes are free-text and not governed by formal ISBD elements.
