# Area 1: Title and Statement of Responsibility Area

Area 1 contains the most fundamental identifying information about a resource: its title(s) and the names of those responsible for its intellectual or artistic content. This area forms the primary access point for resource discovery and identification.

## Purpose and Scope

Area 1 elements serve to:
- **Identify resources uniquely**: Distinguish one resource from another
- **Enable discovery**: Provide primary search and browse access points
- **Establish responsibility**: Connect resources to their creators
- **Support multilingual access**: Through parallel titles and translations
- **Clarify content**: Through subtitles and other explanatory information

## Elements in Area 1

### Core Title Elements

#### Title Proper (1.1) - *Mandatory*
