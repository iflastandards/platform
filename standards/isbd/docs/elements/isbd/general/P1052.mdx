# has equinox

The ISBD element "equinox" is found within the context of cartographic resources, specifically celestial charts, within Area 3: Material or Type of Resource Specific Area > 3.1 Mathematical data.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

**Scope and Purpose:** The equinox, along with the epoch, provides a temporal reference for celestial coordinates (right ascension and declination). These coordinates change over time due to precession, so specifying the equinox is essential for accurately locating celestial objects.

**User Tasks Supported:**
- Precise retrieval of celestial charts based on time.
- Accurate interpretation of celestial coordinates.
- Understanding the temporal context of the chart.



## Element Values

**Rules and Guidelines:** The equinox is expressed as a year, sometimes followed by a decimal number to indicate the precise month. It is preceded by the term "equinox" or its equivalent in another language. If both epoch and equinox are given, they are separated by a comma.

**Value Constraints and Formats:** The year is typically expressed using Arabic numerals.

**String Encoding Schemes:**  Not applicable.


## Examples

```
; equinox 1950
```

```
; epoch 1948, equinox 1950
```

```
(RA 16 h 30 min to 19 h 30 min/Decl. -16° to 49°; equinox 1950)
```

```
(ゾーン+30°;分点 1950)  (Japanese, where 分点 means equinox)

```

```
; equinoccio 1900.0 (Spanish)
```



## Relationships

**Relationships to other ISBD elements:** The equinox is closely related to the `epoch` (3.1.4.1) and `coordinates` (3.1.3) elements.  It is part of the mathematical data that describe a celestial chart.

**Super-types and Sub-types:** None explicitly defined in the ISBD.

**Inverse relationships:**  None.



## Stipulations

**Special Considerations:**  The equinox is provided only when coordinates are also given. If the equinox information isn't present on the resource itself, it can be derived from other sources and supplied in square brackets.

**Exceptions:** No specific exceptions noted in ISBD for the `equinox` element itself, though general exception rules for unspecified sources apply.

**Best Practices:**  Always provide the equinox when giving coordinates for a celestial chart. Be consistent in using the term "equinox" or its equivalent in the language chosen for the description. If deriving the equinox from another source, clearly indicate this in a note.
