# Edition Area Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This area (Area 2) records information about the **edition, drafting, version, etc.**, of a resource. For unpublished resources, it can specify the stage of the production process for pre-publication materials, the state of a drafting, or the version of a file.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
- **Edition, drafting, version, etc. statement (Mandatory if available):** Usually includes the word "edition" (or equivalent) with a number (e.g., "2nd ed."), or a term indicating difference (e.g., "new edition," "revised version," "first draft," "release 0.5").
- **Parallel edition, drafting, version, etc. statement (Optional):** An equivalent edition statement in another language or script.
- **Statement of responsibility relating to the edition, drafting, version, etc. (Mandatory if available):** Refers to persons or corporate bodies responsible for the specific edition, such as revisers or those providing supplementary matter within that edition.
- **Additional edition, drafting, version, etc. statement (Mandatory if available):** A formal statement identifying the resource as belonging to an impression within an edition, or an edition equivalent to the first-named edition, especially if it has significant content differences from other impressions.
- **Statement of responsibility relating to an additional edition, drafting, version, etc. statement (Mandatory if available):** Responsibilities related to the additional edition statement.

</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
- Each **parallel edition, drafting, version, etc. statement** is preceded by **=**.
- The **first statement of responsibility** (related to the edition or following an additional statement) is preceded by **/**.
- Each **subsequent statement of responsibility** is preceded by **;** (unless statements form a single phrase).
- An **additional edition, drafting, version, etc. statement** is preceded by **,**.

</div>

## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
This is identified as **Area 2** in the ISBD specification. It's crucial for distinguishing different versions or iterations of a work.
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
- Information related to the production process (e.g., master, matrix) is transcribed in the **Material or Type of Resource Specific Area (Area 3)**, not here.
- Edition statements that are an integral part of the title proper or other title information are recorded in the **Title and Statement of Responsibility Area (Area 1)** and not repeated here.
- Changes in edition statements for serials or integrating resources may require a new description or be noted in the **Note Area (Area 7)**.

</div>
