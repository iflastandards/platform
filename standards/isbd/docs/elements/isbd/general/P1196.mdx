# is manifestation reflected in

The element "is manifestation reflected in" (isbd:elements/P1196) is **not explicitly defined** within the provided ISBD documentation. The ISBD standard focuses on describing manifestations themselves, not on relationships *between* manifestations.  The concept of one manifestation being "reflected in" another seems to imply a derivative relationship, which would typically be handled through notes regarding reproductions (7.2.4.2), relationships to other resources (7.2.4), or potentially as part of the edition area (Area 2) if it constitutes a new edition.

While the ISBD doesn't define this specific relationship, it does offer mechanisms to express related concepts, as described above.  Therefore, the following sections will outline how one might represent similar relationships using existing ISBD elements and principles, acknowledging the absence of the specific element requested.

## Element Reference (Using related ISBD concepts)

Since the element isn't directly present, we'll refer to the relevant existing elements:

- **7.2.4 Relationships to Other Resources:** This section broadly covers how to document connections between resources.
- **7.2.4.2 Reproductions:** This is the most relevant subsection for expressing that a resource is a reflection of another, particularly if it's a facsimile, copy, or other type of reproduction.
- **Area 2 (Edition Area):** If the "reflection" constitutes a new edition, revision, or version of the original, it would be noted here.


## Additional Information (Using related ISBD concepts)

- **Scope and Purpose:** To clarify the relationship between a resource and another resource from which it derives or which it reproduces.
- **User Tasks:** Helps users understand the nature of the relationship (e.g., reproduction, adaptation, translation) and locate related resources.


## Element Values (Using related ISBD concepts)


- **Rules and Guidelines:**  Notes are generally free text, but should provide sufficient information to identify the related resource.  This typically includes the title, statement of responsibility, and publication information.  Standard abbreviations can be used.
- **Formats:**  Free text, but consistent formatting within a catalog is recommended.
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 is the recommended encoding for ISBD records.

## Examples (Using related ISBD concepts)


```
7.2.4.2 Facsimile reproduction. Originally published: London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1795.
```

```
7.2.4 Translation of: La guerra del fin del mundo.  Original title: The war of the end of the world.
```

```
7.2.4 Based on characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle.
```

```
Area 2 2nd ed., rev. and expanded. Originally published as: Introduction to quantum mechanics.
```

```
7.2.4 Adaptation of: King Lear by William Shakespeare.
```


## Relationships (Using related ISBD concepts)


- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:** Related to Area 1 (Title and Statement of Responsibility) and Area 4 (Publication, Production, Distribution, etc.) as it often involves citing another resource's bibliographic information.
- **Super-types and sub-types:** Not applicable in this context, as it's a descriptive note, not a formal element with a structured hierarchy.


## Stipulations (Using related ISBD concepts)


- **Special Considerations:**  The level of detail provided in the note should be appropriate to the context and user needs.  For less well-known related resources, fuller bibliographic information should be provided.
- **Best Practices:** Be consistent in the wording and punctuation used in notes within a catalog.  Follow established cataloging guidelines for citing related resources.  Use standard abbreviations when appropriate.



This approach, using existing ISBD mechanisms, allows for the description of relationships akin to "is manifestation reflected in," even though that precise element is not defined within the standard itself.  It emphasizes clarity and consistency in providing information about related resources to catalog users.
