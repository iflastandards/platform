# has number of sound channels

The ISBD element "number of sound channels" is found within the Material Description Area, specifically under Other physical details, and pertains primarily to sound recordings.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element specifies the number of distinct audio channels present in a sound recording. This information is crucial for determining playback compatibility and understanding the audio characteristics of the resource.  It helps distinguish between mono, stereo, quadraphonic, and other multi-channel audio formats.
- **User Tasks Supported:**
    - Identifying appropriate playback equipment.
    - Distinguishing different audio formats (mono, stereo, surround sound).
    - Understanding the audio experience intended by the creator.
    - Selecting resources based on specific audio requirements.


## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:** The number is given in Arabic numerals.  If the number of channels is not readily ascertainable, it is omitted.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:** Positive integers only.
- **String Encoding Schemes:** Not applicable.

## Examples

```
1 sound disc: 33 1/3 rpm; 30 cm; mono
1 sound reel (100 min): 19 cm/s; 2 tracks; stereo
1 sound reel (45 min): 19 cm/s; 4 tracks; quad
1 sound disc (74 min): DDD; 5.1 surround sound
1 sound cassette (60 min): stereo
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** This element is related to other technical specifications like `playing speed`, `number of tracks`, `track configuration`, `equalization`, and `noise reduction`.  It is part of the larger `material description area`.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:**  No formal sub-types in ISBD, but conceptually related to general audio formats like mono, stereo, multi-channel.
- **Inverse Relationships:** None specified.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations/Exceptions:** For resources where the number of channels is implicit in the specific material designation or other elements (like a standard cassette labeled "stereo"), the element can be omitted.  For resources with varying numbers of channels (like a compilation album), the information may be best provided in a contents note.
- **Best Practices:**  When providing the number of sound channels, it's often helpful to include other relevant technical information in the same area for completeness.  For example, for a sound disc, one might include the playing speed (rpm) and the recording method (AAD, ADD, DDD).  For more complex audio configurations, consider providing a detailed description in a note.
