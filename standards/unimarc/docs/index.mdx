## Overview

**UNIMARC Standard**

The UNIMARC format is a widely used standard for the representation and exchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form. It defines the codes and conventions (tags, indicators, subfield codes, and coded values) that identify the data elements in UNIMARC bibliographic and authority records. UNIMARC is maintained by an IFLA committee, the Permanent UNIMARC Committee (PUC). Proposals for change usually originate with those creating UNIMARC records or those using UNIMARC records. Changes are made only through the PUC.

The version included here: UNIMARC Bibliographic 3rd edition with updates up to 2016.
Last updated on this site: June 2020

Newer edition to be added to this site in summer 2023
