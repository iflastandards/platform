# has dependent title designation of series or multipart monographic resource

The ISBD element "dependent title designation of series or multipart monographic resource" is mentioned within the context of other elements, but does not have its own distinct definition, properties or examples in the 2021 update to ISBD. It is primarily used as a structural component within the "Series and Multipart Monographic Resource Area."  Therefore, I can't break it down into the requested structured format.  Instead, I'll provide information based on its usage within the context of Series and Multipart resources.


## Dependent Title Designation within Series and Multipart Resources

The concept of "dependent title designation" within series or multipart monographic resources is closely tied to the elements "common title" (6.1) and "dependent title" (6.3.2 or 1.1.5.3).  It helps clarify the relationship between a resource and the larger publication it belongs to. This is especially important when a section, supplement, or part of a resource has a title that isn't enough to identify it without mentioning the larger title it's a part of.

Here is how dependent title designation is used:

* **Series:** A main series may have subseries. The subseries can have dependent titles. The subseries title designation is usually a number, letter, or phrase that precedes the subseries name.

* **Multipart Monographic Resources:** The main title is a common title and individual parts may have dependent titles. The designation is usually a volume, part, or section number that comes after the common title and before the dependent title.


## Examples within Context

Here are examples showing how dependent title designations function as *part* of larger series statements in bibliographic records. Note that the designation itself is not explicitly separated, but you can infer it.

```
(Advanced calculus. Student handbook)  
//Student handbook is the designation

(Histoire du peuple anglais au XIXe siècle. Épilogue) 
//Epilogue is the designation

(Ordnance Survey of Great Britain one inch to one mile map. Seventh series. Sheet 145, Banbury)  
//Seventh series; Sheet 145, Banbury is the designation (a subseries and a specific sheet)


(The German pre-classics. Series A, George Philipp Telemann) 
//Series A is the designation

(Mix and match games. Module 1, Letters)  
//Module 1 is the designation
```

## Relationships to Other Elements

The dependent title designation is always used in conjunction with:

* **Common title:**  The overarching title shared by multiple resources (e.g., main series title, multipart resource title).
* **Dependent title:** The specific title of the part, section, or supplement that's dependent on the common title.


## Stipulations

* **Insufficient Titles:** The dependent title designation is only needed when the title of the part or supplement isn't sufficient to identify it alone.
* **Area 6 or Area 1:**  In series, the designation and dependent title appear within the Series area (Area 6).  In multipart monographic resources, they are part of the Title Proper (Area 1) if being treated as a single work, or in the Series Area (Area 6) if the parts are being linked to a broader multipart resource.



Although the "dependent title designation" is not a stand-alone ISBD element like "Title Proper" or "Edition Statement," its implicit presence is crucial for proper structuring and understanding of series and multipart resources. It provides the contextual link between the part and the larger whole.
