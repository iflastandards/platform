- CSV method for large vocabularies
- Adding multiple languages
- Customizing display options
- Migration from legacy formats

**Best for:** Anyone creating vocabulary documentation

## üéØ Choosing the Right Approach

### For Small Vocabularies (< 20 terms)
Use the **text/YAML method**:
- Everything in one file
- Easy to edit directly
- No external dependencies
- Quick to set up

### For Large Vocabularies (20+ terms)
Use the **CSV/spreadsheet method**:
- Manage in Excel or Google Sheets
- Easy collaboration
- Bulk editing capabilities
- Import/export support

### For Automated Workflows
Use the **Google Sheets integration**:
- Automated vocabulary creation
- Version control
- Team collaboration
- API access

## üí° Quick Start Templates

### Minimal Vocabulary (YAML)
```yaml
---
vocabularyId: "my-vocab"
title: "My Vocabulary"
concepts:
  - value: "term1"
    definition: "Definition of term 1"
  - value: "term2"
    definition: "Definition of term 2"
---

# My Vocabulary

<VocabularyTable {...frontMatter} />
```

### Vocabulary with CSV
```yaml
---
vocabularyId: "my-vocab"
title: "My Vocabulary"
description: "A vocabulary loaded from CSV"
---

# My Vocabulary

<VocabularyTable 
  {...frontMatter}
  csvFile="vocabularies/my-vocab.csv" 
/>
```

## üåê Multilingual Support

All vocabulary creation methods support multiple languages:

- **YAML**: Use language codes as object keys
- **CSV**: Add columns with language suffixes (@en, @fr, @es)
- **Display**: Automatic language switcher in the UI

Example with multiple languages:
```yaml
concepts:
  - value:
      en: "book"
      fr: "livre"
      es: "libro"
    definition:
      en: "A written work published as bound pages"
      fr: "Une ≈ìuvre √©crite publi√©e sous forme de pages reli√©es"
      es: "Una obra escrita publicada como p√°ginas encuadernadas"
```

## üìã Best Practices

### Writing Definitions
- Use clear, simple language
- Be specific and precise
- Avoid circular definitions
- Include distinguishing features

### Using Scope Notes
- Clarify edge cases
- Provide usage examples
- Explain relationships to other terms
- Note inclusions and exclusions

### Organizing Terms
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Consider alphabetical ordering
- Group related concepts
- Plan for future growth

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Resources

### Templates
- [Basic vocabulary template](https://github.com/ifla/standards/templates)
- [Multilingual vocabulary template](https://github.com/ifla/standards/templates)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Choose your method**: Text/YAML for small vocabularies, CSV for large ones
2. **Review the examples**: See how other standards create vocabularies
3. **Start small**: Begin with a few terms to test the process
4. **Get feedback**: Have colleagues review your definitions
5. **Iterate**: Vocabularies evolve - plan for updates
