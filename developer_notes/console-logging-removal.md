# Console Logging Removal

## Summary
Removed all console logging related to site configuration that was outputting to both browser console and build logs.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/packages/theme/src/config/siteConfig.ts`
- Removed console.warn, console.trace, console.log, and console.error calls
- These were logging getSiteUrl function calls and environment resolution

### 2. `/packages/theme/src/config/siteConfig.server.ts`
- Removed console.log calls tracking getCurrentEnv function execution
- Removed logging of process.env.DOCS_ENV and NODE_ENV values

### 3. `/packages/theme/src/config/siteConfigCore.ts`
- Removed console.log that was outputting the DocsEnv enum definition

### 4. `/packages/theme/src/hooks/useDocsEnv.ts`
- Removed console.log calls that were logging:
  - Hook invocation
  - siteConfig.customFields content
  - docsEnv value and type information
  - Fallback warnings

### 5. `/packages/theme/src/index.ts`
- Removed console.info that was logging theme initialization in browser

## Result
- No more console output during build process related to site configuration
- No more browser console logging when sites load
- Cleaner build output and browser console
- All functionality remains intact

## Rebuilding
After these changes, the theme package was rebuilt:
```bash
cd packages/theme && pnpm run build
```

The build completed successfully without any configuration-related console output.
