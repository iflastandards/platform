# has chronological designation

The ISBD element "chronological designation" is used within the Numbering Area (Area 3) specifically for Serials. It represents the date or date range of a serial issue or part.  While there isn't a separately defined "chronological designation" element in the glossary, its use and stipulations are covered under section 3.3, "Numbering (Serials)", and specifically mentioned in sections 3.3.3 (Chronological Designation) and 3.3.4 (Transcription).

## Element Reference

- **Definition:** A date or date range associated with a serial issue or part, often but not always corresponding to the publication date.
- **Domain:** Serials
- **Range:**  Date or date range expressed textually or numerically.
- **Element type:** Data element representing temporal information.

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** To provide temporal context for a serial issue or part, allowing for identification and chronological ordering. Used in conjunction with or independently from numeric designations.
- **User tasks supported:**  Identifying specific issues; Browsing or retrieving issues by date; Chronological sorting and ordering;  Understanding the publication timeline of the serial.


## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** The chronological designation is transcribed as it appears on the source, allowing for abbreviations.
- **Value Constraints and Formats:**  While transcription is generally direct from the source, Arabic numerals are used for years in place of Roman numerals or spelled-out numbers. If the designation includes multiple dates separated by a hyphen, a slash is used instead to avoid confusion with the hyphen used to separate the first and last issue designations.
- **String Encoding Schemes:** No specific string encoding scheme is stipulated, but best practice is to use UTF-8 for maximum interoperability.

## Examples

```
- 15 Jan. 1970-
- Mai 1972-
- 1925-
- 1916 ed.- // If "ed." is part of the chronological designation on the source.
- 1980/1981-  // For designations spanning multiple years.
- 31 Mar. 1961-26 Sept. 1969 // For ranges when the serial has ceased publication.
- Aug./Sept. 1970-  // When the months are given with a hyphen, use a slash instead.
```

## Relationships

- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:** Closely related to the "numeric designation" (3.3.2) within Area 3 for serials. Together, these two elements create a complete numbering statement.  Also related to the publication date in Area 4, although the dates may not always correspond.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** None explicitly defined in ISBD.
- **Inverse relationships:** None specified.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  Dates not from the Gregorian calendar are recorded as they appear on the source, with the Gregorian equivalent in square brackets if possible. Incomplete, inaccurate, or misspelled dates are corrected or completed in square brackets. If a serial adopts a new numbering sequence, both the original and new chronological designations are recorded (3.3.7). For resources with multiple dates given in different calendar systems, record all dates separated by `=`.
- **Best Practices:** Use a consistent format for dates within a given catalog. Prioritize clarity and accuracy. Provide explanatory notes in Area 7 if necessary to clarify any ambiguities or complex numbering patterns.
