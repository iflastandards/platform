# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-31  
**Status**: Planning Phase (PRD-Aligned)  
**Target Completion**: Q2 2025  
**PRD Conformance**: 70% (Critical gaps in Clerk auth, environment testing, and data management)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve E2E and integration test coverage for the IFLA Standards Platform, aligned with the Nx-Optimized E2E Test Strategy PRD. Current implementation achieves 70% PRD conformance but has critical gaps in Clerk authentication (blocking all RBAC tests), environment-specific testing, and test data management. This plan provides prioritized tasks to achieve both 80% test coverage and 100% PRD conformance.

## Current State Analysis

### Coverage Metrics
- **E2E Tests**: 8 active / 15 total (53% active)
- **Integration Tests**: 3 active / 9 total (33% active, RBAC suite fully skipped)
- **Critical Path Coverage**: ~40% (read operations only)
- **Write Operation Coverage**: 0%
- **RBAC Coverage**: 0% (all tests skipped)
- **PRD Conformance**: 70% (see PRD Gap Analysis below)

### Key Gaps
1. All RBAC tests blocked by missing Clerk authentication fixtures
2. No tests for create/update/delete operations
3. Limited user journey and workflow testing
4. Missing external service integration tests
5. No database integration tests

## PRD Gap Analysis

### ‚úÖ Implemented PRD Requirements (70%)
- **Nx Configuration**: Playwright/Vitest orchestration, affected logic, parallel execution
- **Test Categorization**: Tags (@smoke, @integration, @e2e), selective concurrency
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Phase-based workflows, affected optimization
- **Selector Strategy**: Robust selectors, auto-waiting

### ‚ùå Missing PRD Requirements (30%)
1. **Clerk Global Setup** (PRD 3.1): No global setup for authentication/test users
2. **Environment Testing** (PRD 3.1): No Vercel preview or GitHub Pages production tests
3. **Test Data Management** (PRD 2.1): No database seeding or cleanup patterns
4. **Nx Cloud Integration** (PRD 3.1): No flaky test detection or reporting
5. **Performance Targets** (PRD 4): Pre-push exceeds 5min target
6. **Coverage Tracking** (PRD 3.2): No per-PR coverage reports
