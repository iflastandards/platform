# has item aspect

The element "item aspect" (isbd:elements/P1191) is not explicitly defined in the provided ISBD documentation. The ISBD standard focuses on describing the *manifestation* of a resource, and while it acknowledges the concept of *items* (individual copies of a manifestation), it doesn't provide elements for describing aspects specific to individual items. The description in Area 7 (Notes) may sometimes indirectly reflect item-level aspects (e.g., imperfections in a specific copy), but this is not a structured element like title, edition, or publisher.


It is important to note that FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) distinguishes between *manifestations* and *items*. The ISBD primarily describes manifestations, while item-specific information is typically handled in local cataloging practices or other standards outside the scope of ISBD.  Therefore, attributes like condition, provenance, binding variations, or annotations specific to a single copy would not be part of the core ISBD description.


If you are looking for information on how to represent item-specific details, you might want to consult standards like RDA (Resource Description and Access), which provides more granular control over item-level description.
