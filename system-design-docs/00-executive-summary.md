# Executive Summary - IFLA Standards Platform System Design

**Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Status:** Consolidated Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This executive summary provides a high-level overview of the IFLA Standards Platform's system design, consolidating insights from extensive documentation analysis and architectural evolution from 2024-2025. The platform now implements a GitHub Projects-centric organizational model and Nx-optimized testing strategy for enhanced collaboration and quality assurance.

## Platform Vision

The IFLA Standards Platform is a modern, Git-centric system for managing international library standards. It provides a collaborative environment for creating, reviewing, publishing, and maintaining vocabularies and metadata standards used by libraries worldwide. The platform enables focused, project-based collaboration through Review Groups and chartered Teams, similar to W3C working group models.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Monorepo Architecture**
- **Decision**: Nx-based monorepo structure
- **Rationale**: Simplified dependency management, consistent tooling, optimized builds
- **Impact**: 5-minute builds with caching, unified development experience

### 2. **Git as Source of Truth**
- **Decision**: All vocabulary data stored in Git
- **Rationale**: Version control, audit trail, collaboration features
- **Impact**: No data loss, complete history, PR-based workflows

### 3. **Distributed Storage Strategy**
- **Decision**: Purpose-specific storage systems
- **Components**:
  - Git/GitHub: Vocabulary definitions
  - Clerk: User authentication (8KB limit)
  - Supabase: Operational data
  - Google Sheets: Temporary workspaces
- **Impact**: Optimized performance, clear boundaries

### 4. **Centralized Configuration**
- **Decision**: Single TypeScript configuration matrix (December 2024)
- **Previous**: 36+ environment files
- **Impact**: Eliminated cross-contamination, improved maintainability

### 5. **Nx-Optimized Testing Strategy**
- **Decision**: Tag-based, environment-specific testing with Nx affected
- **Categories**: @smoke, @integration, @e2e with targeted execution
- **Impact**: 70% reduction in test time, improved reliability, minimal CI costs
