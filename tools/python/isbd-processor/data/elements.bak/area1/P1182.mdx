# has common title of parallel title

The ISBD element "common title of parallel title" (isbd:elements/P1182) is not explicitly defined as a separate element in the provided ISBD documentation.  Instead, the concept of a common title applies to both the title proper and the parallel title as a shared component when dealing with dependent titles.

## Element Reference

The ISBD documentation does not provide a separate definition for "common title of parallel title". The concept is addressed through the broader definition of "common title" and its application to both title proper and parallel title.

## Additional Information

The scope and purpose of a common title, whether for the title proper or a parallel title, is to link related resources that share a common overarching title but also have distinct dependent titles. This is especially relevant for series, multipart monographic resources, and component parts.

User tasks supported by this element include identifying relationships between resources, understanding the hierarchical structure of complex resources, and facilitating more precise retrieval in bibliographic searches.

## Element Values

The rules and guidelines for using common titles (which applies to parallel titles) are outlined in sections 1.1.3.7, 1.1.4.6.1, and 6 of the ISBD documentation. The common title is transcribed as it appears on the resource, following the general transcription rules for titles.

## Examples

Since the "common title of parallel title" is not a distinct element, the examples will illustrate the application of "common title" to parallel titles.  Essentially, each parallel title would have its corresponding dependent title within the same series.


```
(International Journal of Law = Revue internationale de droit. European Union Law = Droit de l'Union Européenne)
```

```
(Sounds of Nature = Sons de la nature. Bird Songs = Chants d'oiseaux)
```

```
(World History = Histoire du Monde. Ancient Greece = La Grèce antique)
```

## Relationships

The "common title" (and by extension its application to parallel titles) is related to the "dependent title" element. The common title is the overarching title shared by several related resources, while the dependent title distinguishes the individual resource within the group.  This is covered in sections 1.1.3.7, 1.1.4.6.1, and 6 of the ISBD documentation.

## Stipulations

Special considerations:  When the title proper consists of a common title and a dependent title, any parallel title should follow the same structure, with a parallel common title and a parallel dependent title.


Best practices:  Ensure consistency in the application of common titles to both the title proper and parallel titles. If a common title is used for the title proper, it should also be used for any parallel titles if they are part of the same series or multipart resource.  If the series information is included for the title proper, it should also be included for the parallel titles.
