# has note on different editions

The ISBD element "note on different editions" is found within the broader category of "Notes on the edition area and the bibliographic history of the resource" and corresponds to relationship information recorded in note area 7.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** To provide information about other editions of the same resource that were published simultaneously, which may differ in partial content and/or language.  This helps users understand the context of the described resource and locate other related editions.
- **User Tasks Supported:** Identifying all available editions of a work, understanding differences between simultaneously published editions (e.g., language, abridgements, content variations), selecting the most appropriate edition for a specific need.

## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:** The note should clearly identify the other editions, providing enough information to distinguish them. This might include the edition statement (e.g., "Large print edition," "Teacher's edition"), language, or significant content variations.  If the other editions have distinctive titles, those should be used. The guidelines in Area 1 for recording titles and statements of responsibility generally apply. If there are too many editions to list conveniently, a general note (like "Numerous other editions") can be used.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:** No strict format is prescribed, but clarity and conciseness are recommended.
- **String Encoding:**  UTF-8 is generally recommended for modern cataloging.

## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** This note type expands on the information given in Area 2 (Edition Area) and clarifies the relationship between different manifestations of the same work.
- **Super-types/Sub-types:**  This note type could be considered a sub-type of "note on relationship to other resources."
- **Inverse Relationships:** No direct inverse relationship within ISBD.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** When a resource is published in multiple, easily named editions, list the other editions. If there are many editions or they are difficult to name individually, a general note suffices. If different simultaneous editions are created by adapting or modifying an edition, use a separate bibliographic record for each of the derivative editions and link these to the bibliographic record for the original or the closest to an original edition using the note "adapted from" or "modified from".
- **Best Practices:**  Be as specific as possible when identifying other editions.  If possible, provide identifiers (ISBN, ISSN) for each different edition.  If the differences are very substantial, consider creating separate bibliographic records linked by notes.
