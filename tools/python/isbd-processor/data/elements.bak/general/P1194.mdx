# is expression reflected in

The element "is expression reflected in" (isbd:elements/P1194) is not explicitly defined in the provided ISBD documentation. The ISBD standard focuses on describing *manifestations*, which are the physical embodiments of expressions.  While the concept of an expression existing independently of its manifestations is acknowledged (particularly in relation to FRBR), the ISBD itself doesn't provide elements for directly describing expressions or the relationship between expressions and manifestations.  Area 7 (Notes) could potentially be used to record information about related expressions, but there's no specific element for this purpose within the ISBD framework.  Therefore, I cannot fill out the requested sections as they are not applicable to this non-existent element.
