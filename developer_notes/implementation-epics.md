## Cross-Epic Dependencies

### Critical Path Analysis
1. **Epic 1** (Foundation) → **Epic 2** (Core Apps) → **Epic 3** (Migration)
2. **Epic 3** (Migration) → **Epic 4** (API) → **Epic 5** (Advanced Features)
3. **Epic 5** (Advanced Features) → **Epic 6** (Testing & Deployment)

### Risk Mitigation
