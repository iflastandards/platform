# UI Mockups for Multi-Element Set Architecture

This directory contains SVG mockups illustrating the proposed interface design for handling multiple element sets within IFLA standard namespaces.

## Mockup Files

### 1. namespace-hub.svg
**The Namespace Landing Page**
- Shows the main entry point for a namespace (ISBD example)
- Displays element sets as cards with key stats
- Shows vocabularies in a grid layout
- Includes namespace-wide statistics bar
- Demonstrates clear visual hierarchy

### 2. element-set-browser.svg
**Element Set Browsing Interface**
- Shows how users browse elements within a specific element set
- Features element set switcher in the header
- Sidebar navigation by element categories
- Table view with sortable columns
- Search and filter capabilities
- Breadcrumb navigation for context

### 3. cross-set-search.svg
**Cross-Element Set Search Interface**
- Unified search across all element sets in a namespace
- Filter checkboxes for selecting specific element sets
- Results show which element set each result belongs to
- Visual differentiation using color-coded badges
- Shows matching context for each result

### 4. unimarc-navigation.svg
**Complex Navigation for Many Element Sets**
- Demonstrates scalability for UNIMARC's 24 element sets
- Tree navigation structure with grouping
- Dropdown menu organization
- Quick access grid for common sets
- Integrated search across all sets
- Educational content about the structure

### 5. element-comparison.svg
**Element Set Comparison Tool**
- Side-by-side comparison of elements
- Visual indicators for differences
- Shows domain/range constraints clearly
- Summary statistics of differences
- Toggle between views (side-by-side vs differences only)

## Design Principles

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**
   - Namespace → Element Sets → Categories → Elements
   - Consistent use of color coding
   - Clear typography and spacing

2. **Scalability**
   - Simple card layout for few element sets (ISBD)
   - Tree navigation for many element sets (UNIMARC)
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity

3. **Context Awareness**
   - Breadcrumbs show current location
   - Element set switcher always visible
   - Color coding for different element sets

4. **User-Friendly Navigation**
   - Multiple ways to find elements
   - Search, browse, and filter options
   - Quick switching between element sets

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Layouts that work on desktop and tablet
   - Mobile-specific navigation patterns
   - Collapsible sidebars and menus

## Implementation Notes

- Colors used:
  - ISBD: Blue (#1976d2) for primary, Light blue (#e3f2fd) for highlights
  - ISBD Unconstrained: Pink (#c2185b) for differentiation
  - UNIMARC: Purple (#7b1fa2) for primary
  - Vocabularies: Green (#388e3c)
  - Warnings/Differences: Orange (#ff9800)

- The mockups use standard Material Design principles
- All interfaces maintain WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Search functionality should integrate with existing Algolia search
- Navigation patterns should be consistent across all namespace sites

These mockups provide a visual foundation for implementing the multi-element set architecture while maintaining usability and scalability.
