# has edition area

The ISBD element "edition area" is referred to as the "Edition, drafting, version, etc. area" in the provided 2021 update to ISBD.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information
- **Scope and purpose:** To provide information about the specific edition, version, or iteration of a resource being described, distinguishing it from other iterations of the same work.  This aids in identifying and selecting the correct resource.
- **User tasks supported:** 
    - Identifying a specific iteration of a resource.
    - Distinguishing between different editions, versions, revisions, translations, etc.
    - Understanding the changes or additions made in a specific edition.


## Element Values
- **Rules and guidelines:**
    - The wording of edition statements should be taken directly from the resource.
    - Standard abbreviations can be used (e.g., "ed.", "rev.", "corr.").
    - Arabic numerals should be used for edition numbers.
    - Multiple edition statements are separated by commas.
- **Value constraints or formats:**  Generally, the format is [edition statement] [/ [statement of responsibility relating to edition]].  Specific wording is transcribed from the resource.  See stipulations for specific guidance on unpublished resources.
- **String encoding schemes:**  UTF-8 is recommended, though this may depend on broader cataloging rules.


## Examples

```
2nd ed.
Rev. ed.
3rd rev. and enl. ed. / edited by John Smith.
2023 version
Version 1.2.5
```

## Relationships
- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** Related to the Title and Statement of Responsibility Area (Area 1) as the edition is often part of a work's formal designation. Also strongly related to Area 7 (Notes), where changes in edition across different parts of a multipart resource or across different issues of a serial can be documented.
- **Super-types:** None within the immediate context of ISBD elements. Could potentially be considered a sub-element of a broader "Descriptive Metadata" concept.
- **Sub-types:** The edition area itself has sub-elements, namely the "edition statement", "parallel edition statement", "statement of responsibility relating to edition", "additional edition statement", and "statement of responsibility relating to additional edition statement".
- **Inverse relationships:** None explicitly defined in ISBD.


## Stipulations
- **Special considerations:**  For unpublished resources, the Edition area may include details about pre-publication materials (e.g., "draft", "copy for print") or the state of a manuscript.  Information on the production process is recorded in Area 3, not Area 2.
- **Exceptions:** If the edition statement is an integral part of the title proper (Area 1) or other title information (Area 1), it should not be repeated in Area 2.
- **Best practices:** Be consistent in applying abbreviations and transcription rules. When an edition statement is not present on the resource, a supplied statement may be provided in square brackets, but edition numbers should not be supplied unless the resource clearly has a numbered sequence of editions.  When in doubt, provide information in Area 7 (Notes) instead.
