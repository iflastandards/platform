The ISBD element "note on nature, scope, form, purpose or language" is found within the ISBD documentation. It's discussed in section 7.1.2.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** The element clarifies ambiguities or provides additional descriptive information that aids in resource discovery and selection when the title or other descriptive elements are insufficient. It enhances understanding of the resource's intellectual content and intended use.
- **User Tasks Supported:** Helps users determine the relevance of a resource to their needs, especially when the title is generic or unclear. Supports resource discovery based on subject, genre, or format.

## Element Values

- **Rules/Guidelines:**  Use clear and concise language. Be factual and objective. The note should be in the language chosen by the cataloguing agency.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:** There is no prescribed format, but clarity and conciseness are recommended. The note should be specific to the resource being described.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  The encoding scheme should match the rest of the bibliographic record (e.g., UTF-8).


## Examples

```
Note: Play in 3 acts
```

```
Note: Thesis (doctoral)--Freie Universit√§t Berlin, 1973
```

```
Note: Computer program; requires Java runtime environment
```

```
Note: Documentary production; covers the history of jazz in New Orleans
```

```
Note: Legend in English, French, and German
```

## Relationships

- **Relationship to Other ISBD Elements:** Relates to Area 1 (Title and Statement of Responsibility Area) and Area 3 (Material or Type of Resource Specific Area) by providing supplementary information about the resource's content or form. It also complements Area 0 (Content Form and Media Type Area).
- **Super-types/Sub-types:** This element could be considered a sub-type of a general note (Area 7).  Specific types of notes within this category could be further distinguished, such as "note on language," "note on genre," etc., although the ISBD doesn't formally define these sub-types.
- **Inverse Relationships:** None explicitly defined in ISBD.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** This note is used only when information about nature, scope, form, purpose, or language cannot be derived from other descriptive elements.  Avoid redundant information.  For notes about language, see section 7.1.2.2, which suggests giving a language note only when the linguistic content is significant and cannot be inferred.
- **Best Practices:**  Use standard terminology for genres, forms, and types of resources whenever possible.  For unpublished resources, elements like incipit, explicit, date, place, etc., can be provided as other title information (1.3) when a devised title is given and the information is considered useful for identification. (1.3.3.2)
