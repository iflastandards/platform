# Content Form And Media Type Statement Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This refers to the **combined, formatted statement** of the content form(s), production process (if applicable), and media type(s) that forms the core description within **Area 0 (Content Form, Production Process and Media Type Area)**. It provides an immediate overview of what the resource contains and on what physical carrier it exists.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
It combines the elements from Area 0:
- **Content form:** (Mandatory) The fundamental form (e.g., "Text," "Image," "Dataset").
- **Content qualification:** (Mandatory if applicable) Specific attributes (e.g., "(visual)", "(cartographic ; still ; 2-dimensional)").
- **Production process:** (Optional) Method of fixation and production (e.g., "handwriting," "burning").
- **Production process qualification:** (Optional) Status of production (e.g., "(unpublished)").
- **Media type:** (Mandatory) Type of carrier (e.g., "electronic," "unmediated," "video").

</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
The punctuation patterns define how these elements are combined:
- **Content form (content qualification) : production process (production process qualification) ; media type**.
- **Content form (content qualification ; content qualification) : media type**.
- **Content form. Content form (content qualification) : media type** (for different content forms in one media type).
- **Content form (content qualification) : production process ; media type + Content form (content qualification) : production process (production process qualification) ; media type** (for different media types, content forms, and production processes).

</div>

## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
This is the primary output of **Area 0**, explicitly detailing its structured nature. It was a significant development in the 2011 consolidated edition to provide greater specificity.
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
It integrates the "Content Form," "Production Process," and "Media Type" elements (which themselves could be considered mini-SES) into a coherent statement. It's the practical application of the "Content Form And Media Type Area Encoding Scheme."
</div>

## Examples

<div className="stip">
- **Dataset : electronic**
- **Text (visual) : handwriting (unpublished) ; unmediated**
- **Image (cartographic ; still ; 2-dimensional ; visual) : unmediated**
- **Text (visual) : unmediated + Text (visual) : microform**

</div>
