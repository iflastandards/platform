# has note on numbers

The ISBD element "note on numbers" (isbd:elements/P1092) is found within the ISBD documentation and corresponds to section 7.10.4 in the PDF.

## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD Definition:** Numbers or identifiers associated with the resource but not given in area 8 may be given in a note.
- **Domain:**  Relates to a bibliographic resource.
- **Range:**  A textual note containing numbers or identifiers.
- **Element Type:** Descriptive.

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element allows for the inclusion of any numbers or identifiers relevant to the resource that don't fit within the formally defined areas, particularly Area 8 (Resource Identifier and Terms of Availability).  This can include various control numbers, report numbers, technical report numbers, deposit numbers, or other identifiers assigned by organizations or publishers.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  Enhanced resource discovery and identification; disambiguation between similar resources; facilitating retrieval in systems using different identification schemes.

## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** The note should clearly state the type of number being provided (e.g., "Report number:", "Technical report number:", "Contract number:").  If the number is part of a specific scheme, the name of the scheme should be included (e.g., "ERIC document number:").
- **Value Constraints and Formats:**  No specific format is prescribed, but clarity and consistency are essential. If a standard format exists for the particular type of number, it should be followed.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  Not applicable, as this element appears within a textual note.

## Examples

```
Note: Report number: PB85-100448
```

```
Note: Technical report number: UIUCDCS-R-89-1501
```

```
Note: Contract number: DAAG29-80-C-0041
```

```
Note: Project number: DOE/ER/01198
```

```
Note: ERIC document number: ED296688
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:**  Complements Area 8 (Resource Identifier and Terms of Availability) by providing additional identifying numbers. Can also relate to information provided in other areas, if the number clarifies or expands upon that information.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:**  No formal super- or sub-types are defined within the ISBD standard itself, though individual cataloging agencies or systems might define them for their specific needs.
- **Inverse Relationships:** None explicitly defined.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** Only numbers considered important for users of bibliographic records should be included. Avoid redundant information already present in other areas.
- **Exceptions:** No exceptions noted in the ISBD.
- **Best Practices:** Be as specific as possible when identifying the type of number provided. Use established labels and standard formats where they exist.  Maintain consistency in presentation across records.
