# LRM Implementation Examples

This page will contain practical examples of implementing the IFLA Library Reference Model.

## Coming Soon

Example implementations and use cases are currently being developed. Future content will include:

- Basic entity modeling examples

- Relationship mapping demonstrations
- RDF representation examples
- Integration with existing cataloging practices

## Quick Reference

While detailed examples are being prepared, here are some key concepts:

- **Work**: The intellectual or artistic content
- **Expression**: The realization of a work
- **Manifestation**: The physical embodiment of an expression
- **Item**: A single exemplar of a manifestation
