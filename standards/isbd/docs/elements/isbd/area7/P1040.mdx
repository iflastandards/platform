# has note on material description

The ISBD element "note on material description" is found within Area 7 (Notes) of the ISBD, specifically under 7.5 "Notes on the material description area".  It doesn't have a unique formal name like "note on title proper" (isbd:P1016), but is rather a general category of notes within Area 7, as outlined in section 7.5.

## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD definition:** Notes on the material description area may include additional physical description of the resource supplementing the formal statement given in area 5 and statements on particular physical peculiarities. Notes may also be made on accompanying material or on earlier physical details of an integrating resource. (ISBD: 7.5)
- **Domain and Range:** Not formally defined in RDF, but can be conceptually understood as having a domain of "resource" and a range of "textual note".
- **Element type:**  Descriptive textual note.

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:**  Provides further details or clarifies ambiguities about the physical description of a resource that are not captured by the structured elements of Area 5. It allows for detailed description of aspects like the physical extent,  specific illustrative content, technical details of audiovisual materials, format peculiarities, imperfections, or even details about digitization.
- **User Tasks Supported:** Helps users understand the physical format and characteristics of the resource, aids in resource identification and selection (especially for resources with complex physical characteristics), and assists in the handling, preservation and use of the resource.

## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** Notes should be concise, accurate, and relevant to the resource being described.  Follow the language and script stipulations of Area 7. Prescribed punctuation from Areas 1-6 may be used within notes for clarity, especially when citing titles and statements of responsibility.
- **Value Constraints and Formats:** No specific format constraints are imposed, but it is recommended to follow existing conventions for describing physical characteristics (e.g., using standard abbreviations for measurement units).
- **String Encoding:** Follow general text encoding guidelines for the chosen script.


## Examples

```
. - 271 p. : ill. ; 21 cm.
Note: Illustrations coloured by hand.
```

```
. - 1 sound disc: 33 1/3 rpm, mono; 30 cm.
Note: Disc impressed on rectangular surface, 20 x 20 cm
```

```
. - 1 microfilm reel : cine mode.
Note: Available on diazo or silver halide film. Copy imperfect: missing frames 3-5.
```

```
. - 1 wallchart.
Note: Folded to 24 x 15cm. Laminated for preservation.
```

```
. - 1 portfolio (12 plates).
Note: Plates are prints, numbered I-XII.  Plate VI damaged.
```

## Relationships

- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:** Supplements and clarifies information provided in Area 5 (Material Description). May provide context or explanation for information in other areas, such as explaining discrepancies in numbering or publication details.  Can also relate to Area 8 when explaining details of available formats that affect the resource identifier or terms of availability.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** Notes in 7.5 are a subtype of notes within Area 7.  More specific types of notes within 7.5 are mentioned in the ISBD (e.g., notes on number of lines to the page, collation, etc.), but they do not have a formalized RDF structure.
- **Inverse relationships:**  None explicitly defined.


## Stipulations

- **Special considerations:**  Avoid redundancy with information already provided in Area 5.  Information unique to the specific copy being cataloged should be included in 7.11 (Notes relating to the copy in hand) rather than 7.5.
- **Best practices:** Use standard terminology and abbreviations where appropriate. Keep notes concise and focused on the physical aspects of the resource. Prioritize information that is important for resource identification, selection, and handling.  If the note refers to information found elsewhere in the resource, provide a specific location (e.g., page number, colophon).
