# has groove direction

The ISBD element "groove direction" is found within the "Other physical details" element (isbd:P5061) in Area 5 (Material Description Area) of the ISBD.

## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD Definition:** The groove direction of an analog sound disc is given if known. (5.2.7.5 Groove direction)

- **Domain:** Analog sound discs.
- **Range:** String describing the direction of the grooves.

- **Element Type:** Descriptive.


## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element provides information about the physical orientation of the grooves on an analog sound disc, which can impact playback.  It helps to distinguish between different types of discs and ensures proper playback on compatible equipment.

- **User Tasks Supported:**  Aiding in the identification and selection of appropriate playback equipment; facilitating more precise resource description.


## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:**  Use terms like "vertical" or "lateral" (or their equivalents in another language) to describe the groove direction. The default, and far more common, direction is lateral and this information is only included if the grooves are cut vertically.

- **Value Constraints/Formats:** The value should be a concise term describing the orientation of the grooves.

- **String Encoding Schemes:**  Not applicable.


## Examples

```
1 sound disc: 78 rpm; 30 cm : vertical cut
```

```
1 sound disc: 33 1/3 rpm, mono; 30 cm : vertical cut
```

```
1 sound disc: 78 rpm, acoustic; 30 cm : vertical cut
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** This element is a sub-element of "Other physical details" and is related to other technical specifications for sound recordings in Area 5, such as "Playing speed" (5.2.7.3), "Recording method" (5.2.7.4), and "Groove size" (5.2.7.6). It is also associated with the "Specific material designation" (5.1.2) which identifies the resource as a sound disc.

- **Super-types and sub-types:** "Groove direction" is a sub-type of the broader "Other physical details" element.

- **Inverse relationships:**  None.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** This element is only applicable to analog sound discs. It is not relevant for other types of sound recordings or other resources. As lateral cut is the standard format for sound recordings, this information would likely only appear in instances of vertical cut grooved discs. In general, if the information is readily available, it should be included to create a comprehensive record.

- **Best Practices:**  Use standardized terminology to describe groove direction ("vertical" or "lateral").  If the groove direction is not readily apparent from the resource, it is preferable to omit the information rather than supplying a conjectural value.
