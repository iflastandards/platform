# has recording method

The ISBD element "recording method" is found within the "Other physical details" element (isbd:P1048) of Area 5 (Material Description Area).  It pertains specifically to sound recordings.

## Element Reference

- **Definition:** The recording method of an *analogue* sound disc. (Implied:  Used when known.)
- **Domain:** Analogue sound discs (a subset of isbd:P1048 "Other physical details" and isbd:P1040 "Material description area").
- **Range:**  Text specifying the recording method (e.g., "acoustic", "electric").
- **Element Type:**  Property (describes a characteristic of the sound disc).

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element provides technical information about how the sound on an analogue disc was captured, aiding in the identification and understanding of the recording's technical qualities and historical context.
- **User Tasks Supported:**
    - Identifying recordings made with specific historical recording technologies.
    - Understanding the potential sound quality and limitations of the recording based on the method used.
    - Researching historical recording methods and practices.



## Element Values

- **Rules/Guidelines:** Use a term that accurately describes the recording method. Common values include  "acoustic," "electric," etc. Be concise and avoid subjective terms.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:** No strict format is prescribed, but consistency in terminology is encouraged.
- **String Encoding:** Standard text encoding applies.


## Examples

```
1 sound disc: 78 rpm; 30 cm : acoustic
```

```
1 sound disc (30 min): 33 1/3 rpm; 30 cm : electric
```

```
3 sound discs (50 min each): 45 rpm, mono : electric; acoustic; electric
```

```
1 sound disc: 80 rpm; 25 cm :  [recording method not known]
```

```
1 sound disc (60 min): 16 2/3 rpm; 30 cm :  hill-and-dale cut
```


## Relationships

- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:** This element is a sub-element of "Other physical details" (isbd:P1048) within Area 5. It is often found in conjunction with other elements describing the physical carrier like "Groove direction" (isbd:P1129) and "Groove size" (isbd:P1130),  "Playing speed" (isbd:P1126), etc. especially when describing older sound recordings.
- **Supertypes/Subtypes:** "Recording Method" can be considered a subtype of technical specifications for sound recordings.
- **Inverse Relationships:**  None specified.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** Only applicable to *analogue* sound discs. This element should *not* be used to describe the format of *digital* recordings (e.g., "PCM", "DSD"), which would be considered part of the Content Form and Media type area.
- **Exceptions/Usage Notes:** If the recording method is not known, this may be stated (e.g.,  "[recording method not known]").
- **Best Practices:** Use established terminology for recording methods. Consult relevant resources on sound recording history and technology for appropriate terms.  When dealing with unusual or obscure methods, a note (Area 7) might be appropriate to provide further clarification.
