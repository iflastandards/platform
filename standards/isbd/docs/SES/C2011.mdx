# Resource Identifier And Terms Of Availability Area Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
<p>This area (Area 8) includes identifiers (numbers or alphanumeric designations) that identify a resource 
according to international standards (e.g., ISBN, ISSN, ISMN) or publishers' designations. 
It also includes statements about the terms under which the resource is available (e.g., price, distribution conditions).</p>
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
- **Resource identifier (Optional):**
  - **Standard identifiers:** ISBN, ISSN, ISMN, URN, DOI, URL, preceded by their customary labels.
  - **Publisher's number (Notated music only):** Preceded by "Publ. no.".
  - **Plate number (Notated music only):** Preceded by "Pl. no.".
  - **Label name and catalogue number (Sound/videorecordings):** The label name followed by 
        all catalogue numbers.
  - **Fingerprint (Older monographic resources):** A unique alphanumeric string.
  - **Music incipit (Music manuscripts):** A series of notes from predetermined staves, 
        serving as an identifier.
- **Qualification to identifier (Optional):** A brief statement (in parentheses) that qualifies, 
    explains, or corrects the identifier (e.g., binding type, "(corrected)", "(invalid)").
- **Key title (Mandatory for continuing resources if ISSN is given):** The unique name assigned by 
    the ISSN Network, inseparably linked to its ISSN.
- **Terms of availability (Optional):** The price (with ISO 4217 currency code) or a statement of 
    other terms if not for sale (e.g., "for hire," "free to educational institutions").

    enclosed in parentheses (e.g., "(to members)", "(annual subscription)").
