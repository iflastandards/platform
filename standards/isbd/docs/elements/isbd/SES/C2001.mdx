## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
The concept of "resource" is fundamental to the entire ISBD standard.  All the areas and elements defined within the ISBD are meant to describe different facets of a resource.  The ISBD does not prescribe how to *encode* this description, just what information should be included in the description.
