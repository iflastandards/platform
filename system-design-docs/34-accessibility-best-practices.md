# Accessibility Best Practices and Standards Alignment

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Active Reference Document

## Overview

This document outlines IFLA's commitment to digital accessibility excellence and our voluntary adoption of international best practices. As a global standards organization, IFLA leads by example in creating inclusive digital experiences that serve all users regardless of ability, technology, or geographic location.

## Standards Leadership Philosophy

### Why IFLA Prioritizes Accessibility

As the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, IFLA has a unique responsibility to demonstrate excellence in information accessibility:

1. **Moral Leadership**: Libraries exist to provide equitable access to information. Our digital platforms must embody this principle.

2. **Global Impact**: Our standards are used worldwide by institutions serving diverse populations with varying abilities and technologies.

3. **Professional Example**: By exceeding accessibility standards, we provide a model for libraries and information organizations globally.

4. **Innovation Driver**: Accessible design often leads to better design for all users, driving innovation in user experience.

### Voluntary Standards Adoption

While IFLA may not be legally bound by specific national regulations, we voluntarily adopt and exceed the most stringent international accessibility standards:

**EU Web Accessibility Directive (2016/2102)**
- We align with its technical standards (EN 301 549)
- We implement its user feedback mechanisms
- We conduct regular accessibility audits as recommended

**UK Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018**
- We follow its implementation timelines as best practice
- We adopt its monitoring and reporting approaches
- We implement accessibility statements as transparency measures

**United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities**
- We support Article 9 (Accessibility) and Article 21 (Freedom of expression and opinion)
- We ensure our standards promote inclusive library services globally
