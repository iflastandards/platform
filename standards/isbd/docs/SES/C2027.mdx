It provides a statement of the **conditions under which a resource may be obtained**, typically its price, or a brief statement if it's not for sale (e.g., "for hire," "free to educational institutions").
</div>

## Required Elements

The element is **Optional**.
- **Price (Optional):** Given with the international standard code for the currency (e.g., "GBP 2.05," "EUR 950").
- **Other terms (Optional):** A brief statement for non-sale availability (e.g., "not for sale," "for hire," "free loan").
