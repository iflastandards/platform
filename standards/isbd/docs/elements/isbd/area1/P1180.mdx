# has parallel dependent title designation of series or multipart monographic resource

The element "parallel dependent title designation of series or multipart monographic resource" is not explicitly defined as a standalone element in the ISBD Consolidated edition of 2011 (updated 2021). However, the concept is present within the broader context of parallel titles and dependent titles within series and multipart monographic resources.  Therefore, the following response will be a constructed understanding based on related elements and overall ISBD principles.

## Element Reference

<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information
- **Scope and Purpose:** This element provides further granularity and disambiguation for series and multipart resources when they exist with parallel titles and are subdivided into sections or parts with dependent titles. It helps differentiate parallel dependent titles sharing the same parallel common title.
- **User tasks:** Facilitates identification and selection of specific parts or sections within a series or multipart resource presented with parallel titles.  Aids in distinguishing between parts of similarly titled series presented in multiple languages.

## Element Values
- **Rules/Guidelines:** Transcribe the parallel dependent title designation from the resource exactly as it appears with the parallel series title.  Standard abbreviations may be used (as described in section A.6 and Appendix D).
- **Constraints/Formats:**  No specific format is prescribed beyond clarity and adherence to the language and script used for the parallel title.
- **Encoding:** Follow the character set and encoding scheme used for the parallel title.


## Examples
```
(Análisis socioeconómico de América Latina. Serie Estudios ; no. 4 = Socio-economic
analysis of Latin America. Series Studies ; no. 4)

(世界文学史. 第1部, 古代 = Historia de la literatura mundial. Parte 1, Antigüedad ; 1)

(Le monde des affaires.  Ventes et marketing = The Business World. - Sales and
Marketing ; vol. 2)
```

## Relationships
- **Related Elements:**  Closely related to `parallel common title`, `parallel dependent title`, `common title`, `dependent title designation`, and `dependent title`.
- **Super/Sub-types:**  Can be considered a subtype of "other title information" within the context of parallel titles of series.
- **Inverse Relationships:**  None specifically defined within the ISBD.

## Stipulations
- **Special Considerations:** This designation only appears when a series or multipart resource has a parallel title and a dependent title structure.
- **Exceptions:**  If a designation appears ambiguous or its relationship to the parallel title is unclear, it might be best recorded as a note instead.
- **Best Practices:** When recording parallel series titles with dependent title designations, it's helpful to also record the corresponding designations in the original language of the series in area 6 for maximum clarity.  For example, if the main series title is in English, and a parallel series title in French is presented along with a parallel dependent title designation, include the English dependent title designation in the primary series statement as well.
