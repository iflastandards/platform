# Classes

This section defines the fundamental classes used in ISBD resource description. Classes provide the structural foundation for organizing bibliographic data.

## Overview

ISBD classes establish the basic entities that can be described using ISBD elements. Unlike properties (which describe relationships and attributes), classes represent the "things" being described.

## Core Classes

### Resource (C2001)

The core class representing an entity, tangible or intangible, that comprises intellectual and/or artistic content and is conceived, produced and/or issued as a unit, forming the basis of a single bibliographic description.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Forms the domain for all ISBD property elements
- Encompasses all types of bibliographic resources
- Represents both physical and digital materials
- Serves as the primary unit of description

**Scope:**
The Resource class includes:
- Printed books and serials
- Electronic resources
- Audiovisual materials
- Cartographic resources
- Music and sound recordings
- Graphics and three-dimensional objects
- Mixed materials

## Role in ISBD Structure

In the ISBD framework, the Resource class serves as:

1. **Domain Foundation**: All ISBD properties have Resource as their domain, meaning they describe aspects of resources
2. **Unifying Concept**: Provides a single conceptual model for diverse material types
3. **RDF Compatibility**: Enables semantic web applications through formal class definition

## Relationship to Properties

The Resource class works in conjunction with ISBD properties across all areas:
- **Area 0**: Content form and media type properties
- **Area 1**: Title and statement of responsibility properties
- **Area 2**: Edition properties
- **Area 3**: Material specific properties
- **Area 4**: Publication and distribution properties
- **Area 5**: Physical description properties
- **Area 6**: Series properties
- **Area 7**: Notes properties
- **Area 8**: Identifier properties

## Implementation Notes

When implementing ISBD in RDF or other semantic frameworks:
- Use the full URI: `http://iflastandards.info/ns/isbd/elements/C2001`
- Declare resources as instances of this class
- Apply ISBD properties to describe resource characteristics

Example:
```turtle
@prefix isbd: <http://iflastandards.info/ns/isbd/elements/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

<http://example.org/resource/1> 
    rdf:type isbd:C2001 ;
    isbd:P1001 "The Great Gatsby" ;
    isbd:P1008 "First edition" .
```
