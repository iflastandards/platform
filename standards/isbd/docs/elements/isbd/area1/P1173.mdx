# has title statement of series or multipart monographic resource

The requested element, "title statement of series or multipart monographic resource," appears to be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of how the ISBD structures series information.  The ISBD doesn't have a single element for the *entire* series statement. Instead, it breaks the series description into individual elements, much like it does for the main resource itself. These elements are contained within Area 6.

Therefore, I cannot provide a response structured exactly as requested. Instead, I'll describe Area 6 of the ISBD, which encompasses the concept you're looking for.


## Area 6: Series and Multipart Monographic Resource Area

**Element Reference:**

- **Official ISBD Definition:** Area 6 contains the descriptive elements relating to a series or a multipart monographic resource to which the resource being described belongs. It includes: 
    - Title proper (6.1)
    - Parallel title (6.2)
    - Other title information (6.3)
    - Statement of responsibility (6.4)
    - International standard number (ISSN/ISBN) (6.5)
    - Numbering within series (6.6)
- **Domain and Range:**  Applies to resources that are part of a series or multipart monograph.  The individual elements within Area 6 have their own specific domains (e.g., the ISSN applies to serials).
- **Element Type:**  Area containing multiple sub-elements.



**Additional Information:**

- **Scope and Purpose:**  To identify the larger bibliographic resource (series or multipart monograph) to which the resource belongs, aiding in collocation and retrieval.  It provides standardized information about the series itself, separate from the description of the individual resource.
- **User Tasks:** Helps users find other resources in the same series, understand the context of the described resource within a larger publication structure, and distinguish between different series with similar titles.



**Element Values:**

- **Specific Rules:** Each sub-element within Area 6 has its own transcription rules (see sections 6.1-6.6 in the ISBD).  Generally, information is transcribed as it appears on the series title page, with prescribed punctuation.
- **Value Constraints:** The title proper should be the chief name of the series. ISSNs and ISBNs must conform to their respective standards. Numbering should accurately reflect the resource's position within the series.
- **String Encoding:** Not specified within the ISBD, but generally follows the encoding of the rest of the record (e.g., UTF-8).




**Examples:**

```
(International Studies in Human Geography; 14)
(Springer Series in Statistics)
(Oxford Handbooks in Linguistics)
(The Cambridge History of Japan; vol. 4)
(FAO Fisheries Synopsis; no. 125, vol. 14)
```




**Relationships:**

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** Area 6 is distinct from Area 1 (Title and Statement of Responsibility) and other areas, providing information specifically about the *series* and not the individual resource. If the resource is part of a multipart monograph *and* a series, both Area 6 (for the series) and an appropriate statement in Area 1 (for the part number) would be included.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** The concept of "common title" and "dependent title" is used for series, subseries, and multipart monographs.  The main series would be the super-type, and subseries or numbered parts would be sub-types.
- **Inverse Relationships:** Not explicitly defined in ISBD.


## Stipulations:

- **Special Considerations:** If a resource belongs to multiple series, Area 6 can be repeated.
- **Exceptions:**  If the series information is integral to the title proper of the resource (e.g., "Volume 4 of the History of England"), it's included in Area 1, not Area 6.
- **Best Practices:**  Transcribe series information accurately and consistently, using the prescribed punctuation to ensure clear identification and interoperability of records. Prefer information from the series title page, if available.  If series information is incomplete or unavailable, use square brackets to indicate supplied information and provide an explanatory note in Area 7.
