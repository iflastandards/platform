# has other physical details

The ISBD element "Other physical details" (isbd:elements/P1023) is found within Area 5 of the ISBD, the Material Description Area.

## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD Definition:** The second element of the material description area is a statement of other physical characteristics of the resource, such as method of production, colour, material from which the resource is made, etc. Any characteristic implicit in the specific material designation may be omitted; for example, the presence of sound for a sound recording or the presence of illustrations for a visual resource may be omitted.
- **Domain:**  Monographic resources, Serials, Cartographic resources, Multimedia/Audiovisual resources,  Electronic resources (when applicable)
- **Range:**  Text
- **Element Type:** Descriptive

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element records the physical characteristics of a resource that are not covered by the specific material designation or extent. It provides more granular details that aid in identifying and differentiating resources. These details can relate to aspects like the material makeup, presence of color, illustrative content, technical specifications for audiovisual resources, and more.
- **User Tasks Supported:** This element supports user tasks such as:
    - Identifying resources with specific physical features (e.g., color illustrations, resources made of wood).
    - Distinguishing between different editions or versions based on physical differences.
    -  Understanding the technical requirements for accessing or using certain resources (e.g., sound speed for a vinyl record).


## Element Values

- **Specific Rules and Guidelines:**  The specifications constituting other physical details are presented in the following order:
    - Composition of material
    - Presence of illustrations (including type and number)
    - Presence of color
    - Reduction ratio (for microforms)
    - Presence/absence of sound
    - Frame alignment (for microfilms/filmstrips)
    - Other technical specifications like playing speed, recording method, groove details, number of tracks (audiovisual), etc.


- **Value Constraints and Formats:** No strict format is prescribed for text values except for reduction ratio (numerical) and some technical specifications for audiovisual materials. Abbreviations (like `col.` for color, `ill.` for illustrations, `sd.` for sound) are encouraged.  The ISBD provides guidelines within the relevant area for specific resource types (see Section 5.2 of the ISBD:2011 document).


- **String Encoding Schemes:**  Not applicable in a general sense.  Specific character encoding might be relevant for electronic resources and would usually be described in other areas or notes.


## Examples

```
1 globe : wood ; 23 cm
```

```
36 slides : col. 
```

```
1 sound disc (50 min) : 33 1/3 rpm, stereo ; 30 cm
```

```
1 microfilm reel : diazo, 14x
```

```
1 videocassette (60 min) : col., sd. (PAL)
```


## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** This element is part of Area 5 (Material Description Area) and is directly related to Specific Material Designation (5.1.2) and Dimensions (5.3).  It may be omitted if the information is implicit in other elements.  Information about containers for resources might also be included here or in the Dimensions element.  More detailed technical information (especially for older resources) or additional physical formats may be given in notes.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** Not explicitly defined within the ISBD. The general element "Other physical details" encompasses more specific sub-elements like "presence of illustrations," "presence of color," "reduction ratio," etc., which are covered within section 5.2.
- **Inverse Relationships:** Not applicable.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations, Exceptions or Usage Notes:** Any physical characteristics implicit in other elements of the description may be omitted.  For example, the material of a book is generally paper, so it does not need to be explicitly stated here. The focus is on characteristics that differentiate the resource. Information about modifications to the resource *after* publication should be recorded in a note, not in Area 5.
- **Best Practices:** Use standard abbreviations where available. Be concise and provide only details relevant to distinguishing the resource or for providing information that might be important to users. For very complex physical descriptions, using notes can be more effective than trying to fit all details into Area 5. Be consistent with the order outlined in Section 5.2.
