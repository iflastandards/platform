# has edition statement

The ISBD element "edition statement" (isbd:P1008) is found within the PDF as "Edition, drafting, version, etc. statement".

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:**  The edition statement indicates a particular release of a resource that differs from other releases in some significant way. This might be due to revisions of content, changes in format, additions of material, or other modifications.  It helps to distinguish between various iterations of the same work.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  The edition statement helps users:
    - Identify a specific version of a resource.
    - Distinguish between different editions of a work.
    - Understand the relationship between different iterations of a resource (e.g., revised, expanded, abridged).
    - Select the most appropriate edition for their needs.

## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** The edition statement should be transcribed from the resource itself. Standard abbreviations may be used (as listed in the ISBD). Arabic numerals should replace other numerals or spelled-out numbers.
- **Value Constraints and Formats:** The statement should reflect the wording on the resource as closely as possible.  It can include descriptive phrases.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  The character set used should be appropriate for the language and script of the edition statement.  (The ISBD itself doesn't mandate a specific encoding.)

## Examples

```
2nd ed.
Rev. ed.
Abridged ed.
Large print ed.
Version 3.2
1st Carroll & Graf ed.
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:**  The edition statement is part of Area 2 (Edition, drafting, version, etc. area) and can be followed by a statement of responsibility relating to that edition (element 2.3). It is distinct from the publication date (Area 4).
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** The "edition statement" is a more general term that encompasses edition, drafting, and version statements.  It might be considered a super-type, with specific types like "edition," "drafting," and "version" as sub-types.
- **Inverse Relationships:**  None explicitly defined in ISBD.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**
    - Statements indicating unchanged reprints (e.g., "5th impression") are also considered edition statements.
    - If the statement mentions a previous title (e.g., "Revised edition of..."), this information belongs in a note (Area 7) and not in the edition statement itself.
    - For unpublished resources, the edition area can include details about production stages, states of drafts, etc., but only for resources with limited circulation.
    - If the edition statement is unavailable on the resource, but the resource is known to differ from other editions, a statement may be supplied in square brackets.
- **Best Practices:**  Transcribe the edition statement accurately from the prescribed sources. Use standard abbreviations when appropriate. When supplying information, clearly indicate that it's supplied by using square brackets. If necessary, add notes to explain or clarify the edition statement.
