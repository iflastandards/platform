# has fingerprint

The ISBD element "fingerprint" is found within the PDF as part of Area 8, Resource Identifier and Terms of Availability Area.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** The fingerprint acts as a unique identifier for older monographic resources, particularly those published before the widespread adoption of standard identifiers like ISBNs. It helps differentiate between different editions of a work and aids in identifying specific copies. It serves a similar purpose as a standard number for older resources.

- **User Tasks Supported:**
    - Identifying a specific edition of an older monographic resource.
    - Differentiating between copies of the same edition with variations.
    - Retrieving bibliographic records for older materials.
    - Collating and comparing copies in different libraries.


## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:**
    - The fingerprint is extracted from pre-determined locations within the text. Though the locations are supposed to be uniform, a definitive, internationally-agreed-upon formula is absent from the PDF.
    -  Include a number indicating the source of the extracted characters (presumably indicating the page, line, etc.), a letter indicating chain-line direction, and/or date from the publication statement.

- **Value Constraints/Formats:** No strict format is defined in the ISBD. It refers to external resources like *Fingerprints = Empreintes = Impronte* and *Nouvelles des empreintes = Fingerprint newsletter* for variations. The examples themselves use differing conventions.

- **String Encoding:** Not specified within the ISBD documentation, but would likely utilize the character encoding appropriate for the language and script of the resource.


## Examples
```
Fingerprint: 163704 - b1 A2,$en: b2 12 a,$
```

```
Fingerprint: ([leaf] a2r, l. 12: [date] 1789)
```

```
Fingerprint: (sig. A2r, word 7; sig. C3v, line 25)
```

```
Fingerprint: (p. 34, line 10; date from colophon)
```

```
Fingerprint: (chain line : u; catchword : the; date : MDCCLXXXIX)
```


## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** The fingerprint is most closely related to the resource identifier (Area 8).  It is considered a substitute for standard identifiers (like ISBN) when those are unavailable for older resources. It could also relate to notes in Area 7 (e.g., to indicate chain line direction).

- **Super-types/Sub-types:**  Not explicitly addressed in the ISBD documentation.

- **Inverse Relationships:** Not applicable.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  The ISBD acknowledges a lack of international consensus on a definitive fingerprint formula. The PDF recommends that cataloging agencies use established forms based on published resources on fingerprint methodology.
- **Best Practices:** Consult existing guidelines and best practices within the rare books community and be consistent in application within a catalog. Where possible, document the method used to generate the fingerprint to allow for validation and comparison.  Include explanatory notes to clarify any ambiguity.  When using a non-standard format, provide a key explaining the elements and their source in the record.
