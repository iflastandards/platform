# has numbering within series or multipart monographic resource

The ISBD element "numbering within series or multipart monographic resource" is found within the Series and Multipart Monographic Resource Area (Area 6) of the ISBD.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element specifies the resource's position or identifier within a larger series or multipart item.  It helps distinguish individual resources within a series and facilitates the ordering and retrieval of parts within a larger whole.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  Locating specific parts of a series, ordering parts of a series, identifying a resource's place in a sequence.

## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:** The numbering is recorded exactly as it appears on the source, including capitalization, punctuation, and spacing. Standard abbreviations may be used. Arabic numerals are used in place of spelled-out numbers or other numerals.  If the numbering appears in more than one language or script, the numbering in the language and script of the title proper is given; if this criterion does not apply, the first numbering is given.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:**  No specific constraints, although the value should represent the numbering as it appears on the resource.
- **String Encoding Schemes:** No specific encoding scheme mandated, but Unicode is generally recommended for best practice in representing a wide range of characters.


## Examples

```
(Beatrix Potter jigsaw puzzles ; no. 1)
(Selected works of Rudyard Kipling ; vol. 2)
(Carte géologique de la France à 1:50000 ; IV-19)
(合唱名曲コレクション ; D 11)
(일론의 땅 시리즈 ; 3탄)
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** Closely related to the "title proper of a series or multipart monographic resource" (6.1) and other elements in Area 6. Can be further clarified or explained by notes in Area 7.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** No direct sub-types in ISBD. Might be conceived as a sub-type of a broader "resource identifier" concept.
- **Inverse relationships:**  Could be argued that a resource "is numbered within" a particular series, which would be an inverse expression.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** If the numbering includes a date or other information which is also part of the chronological designation, it goes in Area 3. (For instance, "1995, vol. 1" would have "1995-" in area 3 and "vol. 1" in area 6.)
- **Exceptions:** When the title of the series has a dependent title or subseries, the numbering for the common title is omitted and only the numbering for the dependent title/subseries appears in Area 6.
- **Best Practices:**  Consistency is crucial.  A cataloging agency should choose a consistent approach to transcribing or recording numbering (e.g., abbreviations, roman vs. arabic numerals) and apply it across all records.  Providing notes in Area 7 to clarify complex or unusual numbering patterns is highly recommended.
