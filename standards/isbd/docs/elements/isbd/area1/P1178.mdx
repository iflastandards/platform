# has parallel common title of series or multipart monographic resource

The ISBD element "parallel common title of series or multipart monographic resource" is found within the Series and Multipart Monographic Resource Area (Area 6) and is used when the title proper of a series or multipart item appears in more than one language or script.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** To provide an equivalent name for the series or multipart item in another language or script, facilitating access and identification for users who may not be familiar with the language or script of the title proper. It enhances international exchange and interoperability of bibliographic data.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  Searching, browsing, and retrieving resources based on series information in different languages. Identifying equivalent series across different language versions.

## Element Values

- **Rules/Guidelines:** The parallel common title is transcribed from the prescribed source exactly as to wording, but not necessarily as to capitalization and punctuation. Follows the rules for transcribing parallel titles in general (Section 1.2).
- **Value Constraints/Formats:**  Should be a valid title in the language and script it represents.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  UTF-8 is recommended for encoding.

## Examples

```
(Minicomputer peripherals = Peripheriques pour miniordiateurs)
(土佐日記 = The Tosa diary)
(세계화 시대의 한국 사회 = Korean society in the age of globalization)
(Carte géologique de la France à 1:50 000 = Geological map of France at 1:50 000)
```


## Relationships

- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:**  Directly related to the "title proper of a series or multipart monographic resource" (6.1) and follows the general rules for parallel titles (1.2). It is subordinate to the common title in hierarchical series descriptions (e.g. Main series. Subseries).
- **Super-types:** Parallel title (1.2)
- **Sub-types:** None explicitly defined.
- **Inverse Relationships:** None explicitly defined.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  Included only if considered necessary for identification or important for users. May be omitted if the common title itself is already multilingual or covers multiple language versions. Parallel common titles are given after the common title and dependent title if present. (6.2.2)
- **Exceptions:** Not applicable if the series is described using the dependent title as an entry point (See 6.6.2).
- **Best Practices:** Provide parallel common titles for all significant languages or scripts in which the series is published. Ensure consistency in the application of capitalization and punctuation rules within each language or script. Use appropriate linking punctuation (=).
