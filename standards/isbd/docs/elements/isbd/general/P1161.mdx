# has material or type of resource specific area

The ISBD element "material or type of resource specific area" (isbd:elements/P1161) is found within Area 3 of the ISBD.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:**  The purpose of Area 3 is to provide information specific to certain resource types that doesn't fit neatly into other descriptive areas. This helps in identifying and selecting resources based on format-specific characteristics. It also allows for specialized information to be recorded consistently across different cataloging agencies.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  Facilitates searching and retrieval based on resource type-specific characteristics (e.g., scale of a map, music format). Enables users to differentiate between resources that might otherwise appear similar based on general description.

## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:** The specific elements, their order, language, and prescribed punctuation within Area 3 are defined within the individual sections of the ISBD related to each resource type (3.1 for Cartographic, 3.2 for Notated Music, 3.3 for Serials, and 3.4 for Unpublished resources).
- **Value Constraints/Formats:**  Varies depending on the specific element.  For example, scale is represented as a representative fraction (1:x).  Numbering follows specific patterns outlined in 3.3. Music format statements are textual. Unpublished statements are textual.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  No specific encoding schemes are mandated, but Unicode is generally recommended for multilingual data.

## Examples

```
Scale 1:250 000; universal transverse Mercator proj. - No. 1 (1970)-
```

```
Scores and parts. - No. 1-
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** Area 3 is directly related to the resource being described. Its values are dependent on the content and format of the resource. For instance, a serial will have numbering in Area 3, whereas a cartographic resource will have mathematical data.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** This area itself doesn't have subtypes in the formal ISBD object model, though the different data types it *contains* (mathematical data, numbering, etc.) could be considered subtypes of a broader "resource-specific information" type.
- **Inverse relationships:** None specified in the standard.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  When a resource is a combination of materials or types of resources that utilize Area 3, the content-related Area 3 information is given first, followed by numbering or production process/media type.
- **Exceptions:** None explicitly stated, though the specific stipulations for different materials may have their own exceptions.
- **Best Practices:** Follow the detailed guidelines for each material type as described in their respective sections of the ISBD to ensure consistency and interoperability. When no specific rules exist for a particular unpublished resource type, use terms and formats that are consistent with the principles of the ISBD and clear to users.  Use notes in area 7 for further clarification when necessary.
