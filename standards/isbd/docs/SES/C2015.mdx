# Specific Material Designation And Extent Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This refers to the naming and numbering of the physical unit(s) that constitute the resource, along with other measures of its extent. It is the **first element** in the **Material Description Area (Area 5)** [411, 5.1]. The **specific material designation (SMD)** identifies the specific class of physical object.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
- **Number of physical units (Optional):** Given in arabic numerals (e.g., "36"). This is omitted if the resource is still being issued or the number is unknown.
- **Specific material designation (Mandatory):** A term indicating the type of physical unit (e.g., "slides," "atlas," "computer disk," "website"). Terms are not prescribed and may be abbreviated.
- **Subunits (Optional):** The number and type of internal subunits (e.g., pages, leaves, frames, pieces) and/or playing time, enclosed in parentheses (e.g., "(37 p.)", "(ca 60 min)").

</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
- The **subunits statement** is enclosed in **parentheses ( )**.
- For multimedia resources, components are separated by **,**.

</div>

## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
This is element **5.1** within Area 5. It is fundamental to the physical description of a resource, providing a concise summary of its physical form and quantity.
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
- It is a component of the "Material Description Area Encoding Scheme."
- Playing time (5.1.5) and pagination (5.1.4) are detailed aspects of this element.
- It is closely related to the "Content Form And Media Type Area Encoding Scheme" (Area 0), as the physical carrier described here is the "Media type" in Area 0.
- For component parts, this information may be inferred from the host and location, and thus omitted from the part's description itself.
- Notes on extent (e.g., if numbering gives a false impression, or if it differs from bibliographic units) are given in the **Note Area (Area 7)**.

</div>

## Examples

<div className="stip">
- **. — 36 slides**
- **. — 1 computer disk**
- **. — 1 score (37 p.)**
- **. — 1 website**
- **. — 3 filmstrips, 1 map, 13 rocks and minerals, 1 wallchart**

</div>
