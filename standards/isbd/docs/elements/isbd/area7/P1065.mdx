# has note on frequency

The ISBD element "note on frequency" is found within the Note Area (Area 7) of the ISBD.  Specifically, it's discussed under section 7.0.2.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:**  This element provides information about how often a serial is published or an integrating resource is updated. It clarifies the periodicity of the resource, which is crucial for managing expectations and understanding the nature of the content.
- **User Tasks Supported:** Helps users understand the publication pattern of a serial or the update frequency of an integrating resource. This is important for subscription management, collection development, and research purposes.

## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** The frequency should be stated clearly and concisely using standard terminology (e.g., "Daily," "Weekly," "Monthly," "Quarterly," "Annually," "Semiannually," "Three times a year,"  "Irregular"). More complex or unusual frequencies should be explained in detail.
- **Value Constraints or Formats:** No strict format is prescribed, but clarity is essential.  Abbreviations may be used if they are unambiguous.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  UTF-8 is recommended.

## Examples

```
Note: Bimonthly
```

```
Note: Irregular
```

```
Note: Monthly (July-August issues combined)
```

```
Note: Continuously updated
```

```
Note: Four times each term
```

## Relationships

- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:** If the frequency is stated in Area 1 (Title and Statement of Responsibility Area), it may be repeated in Area 7 if necessary to convey additional information (e.g., to explain a complex frequency).  It's specifically related to elements in area 3 (Numbering of Serials) when dealing with revisions or updates in serials (e.g. "Revised edition issued every 6 months" would be a frequency note and not an edition statement).
- **Super-types and Sub-types:**  None explicitly defined in ISBD.
- **Inverse Relationships:**  None explicitly defined in ISBD.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** When the frequency of a continuing resource is unknown, the note "Frequency unknown" is given.
- **Exceptions:** N/A
- **Usage notes:** Changes in the frequency of a serial or integrating resource may also be noted in Area 7, following the initial frequency statement. For example:  "Quarterly as from 1975, no. 1-".
- **Best Practices:** Use standard terminology and be as specific as possible when describing the frequency.  If the frequency changes, clearly document the change and the date it took effect.
