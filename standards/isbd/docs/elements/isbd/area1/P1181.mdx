# has compound title of parallel title

The element "compound title of parallel title" (isbd:elements/P1181) is not explicitly defined in the provided ISBD documentation.  While the ISBD discusses parallel titles and compound titles (specifically regarding the *title proper* of a resource), it doesn't provide stipulations for a "compound title *of* a parallel title".  The closest concepts addressed are those of common titles and dependent titles within parallel titles, where the parallel title itself might have components (common title and dependent title).

Since the requested element isn't directly defined, I will instead explain how parallel titles and compound title structures are handled within the ISBD framework, drawing upon related elements and providing relevant examples.

## Parallel Titles and Compound Title Structures within ISBD

The ISBD *does* address compound title structures within the *title proper* field (area 1.1).  A compound title consists of a common title and one or more dependent titles. This structure can also appear within parallel titles.  Here is a breakdown based on related elements and inferred logic:

### Element Reference (for related elements)

* **Parallel title (1.2):** A title in another language or script than the title proper, presented as an equivalent of the title proper.
* **Common title (1.1.3.7, 6.1):** The shared part of a title common to multiple resources belonging to the same series or multipart resource.
* **Dependent title (1.1.3.7, 6.1):** The part of a compound title that follows the common title and provides further specificity.

### Additional Information (inferred)

* **Scope and Purpose:** To enable the description of resources where the parallel title itself exhibits a compound structure, allowing for greater precision and clarity in representing titles in multiple languages/scripts.
* **User Tasks Supported:** Facilitates the identification and retrieval of resources with complex parallel title structures.

### Element Values (inferred)

* **Rules and Guidelines:** The parallel title would be transcribed with its common and dependent parts, following the punctuation guidelines for compound titles within the title proper field (see section 1.1 and section 6 of the ISBD document).
* **Value Constraints:** The common title should be present in all parallel titles of the set. The dependent title should reflect the language/script of its corresponding parallel title.

### Examples

```
Title Proper:  Annual Report.  Part 1, Financial Statements
Parallel Title:  Rapport Annuel.  Partie 1, États Financiers

Title Proper:  Advanced Calculus.  Solutions Manual
Parallel Title:  Cálculo Avanzado.  Manual de Soluciones

Title Proper:  International Journal of Physics.  Supplement 1, Conference Proceedings
Parallel Title:  Revista Internacional de Física.  Suplemento 1, Actas de la Conferencia
```

### Relationships (inferred)

* **Relationship to Other ISBD Elements:**  This compound parallel title structure is a combination of parallel title (1.2), common title (1.1.3.7, 6.1), and dependent title (1.1.3.7, 6.1) elements.
* **Super-types and Sub-types:**  Not applicable in this inferred structure.
* **Inverse Relationships:** Not applicable.

### Stipulations (inferred)

* **Special Considerations:** Ensure consistency in the common title across all parallel titles.  Transcribe each dependent title in the appropriate language/script of the parallel title.


This explanation provides a logical framework for handling compound titles within parallel title fields based on the principles and elements already defined in the ISBD. It is crucial to remember that this is an *interpretation* based on existing ISBD rules, as the "compound title of parallel title" element is not explicitly defined.  Always consult the latest official ISBD documentation for definitive guidance.
