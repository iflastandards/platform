# ISBD Elements (unconstrained)

The ISBD element set is a registration of classes and properties from International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), consolidated edition, published by De Gruyter Saur in July 2011 (ISBN 978-3-11-026379-4). This version has the same local URI part, label, and definition as each element in the constrained version, but no domain (i.e. Resource) or range is declared.
