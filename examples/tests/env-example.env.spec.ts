/**
 * ENVIRONMENT TEST EXAMPLE - IFLA Standards Platform
 * ==================================================
 * 
 * CATEGORY: Environment Tests (@env tag)
 * PURPOSE: Validate environment-specific behavior and configuration
 * EXECUTION: As part of specialized CI tasks
 * 
 * DIRECTORY PLACEMENT:
 * - Centralized under `tests/environment/`
 * 
 * REQUIRED TAGS: @env
 * 
 * NX TARGETS THAT RUN THIS TEST:
 * - nx run-many --target=test --all
 * - As part of specialized CI tasks
 * 
 * GIT HOOKS THAT MAY RUN THIS TEST:
 * - Sometimes part of pre-release verification tasks
 * 
 * WHY THIS IS AN ENV TEST:
 * - Verifies dependencies, environment variables, resource access
 * - Cannot make assumptions about configuration in different envs
 * - Tests distinguishing features across different env setups
 * - Often CI specific, such as when deployed to unique environments
 * 
 * HOW TO USE: Place in env folder; Design tests around env-specific logic

/**
 * SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENT TEST CHARACTERISTICS:
 * 
 * ‚úÖ RESTRICTED: Typically environment-specific tests
 * ‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURABILITY: Verifies configurable settings and logic
 * üîí PROTECTED: Avoids hard dependencies on environment internals
 * üì¶ DEPLOY SIMPLE: Verifies settings without needing heavy mocking
 * 
 * WHEN TO RUN: Specific to env changes, targeted reruns, config checks
 * WHERE TO PLACE: Directly under tests/env, aligned with env-sensitive code
 * HOW TO EXTEND: Add/env expand logic checks, review conditional/env paths
