## GitHub Workflows Cleanup Summary

### ‚úÖ FINAL WORKFLOW SETUP (5 workflows):

1. **ci-env-only.yml** - Environment validation tests (API tokens, external services)
2. **nx-optimized-preview.yml** - Preview branch deployment with Nx caching & distributed execution  
3. **nx-optimized-production.yml** - Production deployment with full validation & security scans
4. **nx-pr-validation.yml** - PR validation with affected builds only
5. **site-validation.yml** - Site validation testing with environment-specific options

### ‚ùå REMOVED WORKFLOWS (9 total):

**Legacy/Deprecated:**
- deploy-dev-legacy.yml (marked as legacy)
- ci-preview-legacy.yml (legacy CI)
- ci.yml (superseded, commented out)
- site-validation-legacy.yml (legacy validation)
- test-site-builds-legacy.yml (legacy build testing)

**Redundant with Nx-optimized:**
- development-deploy.yml (duplicated preview functionality)  
- preview-ci.yml (redundant with nx-optimized-preview.yml)
- test-matrix-enhanced.yml (disabled, complex matrix testing)
- test-site-builds.yml (superseded by Nx workflows)

### üìä IMPACT:
- Reduced from **14 workflows** to **5 workflows** (64% reduction)
- Eliminated maintenance overhead of legacy workflows
- Retained all essential functionality for local/preview/production environments
- Kept environment validation while removing redundancy

Your workflows are now optimized for your Nx-based, three-environment setup!
