## Detailed Findings

### Unnecessary Full Test Runs


### Missing Affected Usage
- **test:admin**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:admin:coverage**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:admin:e2e**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:admin:integration**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:admin:unit**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:admin:watch**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:e2e:legacy**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:e2e:pre-push**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:e2e:affected**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects
- **test:e2e:portal**: Could use nx affected instead of running all projects

### Optimization Opportunities
- **e2e**: Missing testInputs in target configuration
  - Impact: May cause unnecessary test runs due to poor change detection
  - Suggestion: Add "testInputs" to inputs array
- **test**: Hardcoded test execution, no affected detection
  - Impact: All tests run regardless of changes
  - Suggestion: Consider using vitest --changed or nx affected patterns
- **test:unit**: Hardcoded test execution, no affected detection
  - Impact: All tests run regardless of changes
  - Suggestion: Consider using vitest --changed or nx affected patterns
- **test:integration**: Hardcoded test execution, no affected detection
  - Impact: All tests run regardless of changes
  - Suggestion: Consider using vitest --changed or nx affected patterns
- **test:coverage**: Hardcoded test execution, no affected detection
  - Impact: All tests run regardless of changes
  - Suggestion: Consider using vitest --changed or nx affected patterns
- **test:server-dependent**: Hardcoded test execution, no affected detection
  - Impact: All tests run regardless of changes
  - Suggestion: Consider using vitest --changed or nx affected patterns
- **test:specific**: Hardcoded test execution, no affected detection
  - Impact: All tests run regardless of changes
  - Suggestion: Consider using vitest --changed or nx affected patterns

## Optimization Priority
1. **High Impact**: Fix unnecessary full runs in development scripts
2. **Medium Impact**: Add affected usage to frequently used scripts  
3. **Low Impact**: Enable caching and improve configuration

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed to Task 2.3: Configure targeted test execution based on affected projects.
