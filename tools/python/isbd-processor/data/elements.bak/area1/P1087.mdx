# has note on statement of responsibility

The ISBD element "note on statement of responsibility" is found within the broader context of notes related to the title and statement of responsibility area (Area 1) and within Area 7 (Note Area) of the ISBD. It doesn't have its own distinct and separate section with a heading like "note on statement of responsibility" but is covered under various stipulations within those areas.  Specifically, the concept is covered in sections 7.1.4 and 1.4.5 of the provided document.

## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD Definition:**  While not explicitly defined in a single place, a "note on statement of responsibility" refers to a note within Area 7 that provides additional information, clarifications, corrections, or contextual details regarding the statement of responsibility recorded in Area 1.
- **Domain and Range:** Not explicitly defined in RDF terms in the document.  However, conceptually, its domain would be the resource being described, and the range would be a textual note.
- **Element Type:**  Descriptive text.

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** To provide context, explain variations, supply missing information, or clarify ambiguities related to the individuals or bodies responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of the resource.  This might include clarifying roles, providing full names for abbreviated forms, explaining the source of the statement if it's not from the preferred source, and noting changes in responsibility over time for serials or multipart resources.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  Disambiguation of responsibility, understanding the role of contributors, identifying changes in authorship or editorship over time, and generally improving the discoverability and understanding of the resource's creation.


## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:** Notes should be concise, factual, and non-evaluative.  They should provide enough information to be meaningful to the user. Standard abbreviations can be used.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:** No strict format, but clarity and conciseness are recommended.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  UTF-8 is recommended, but not strictly mandated in this specific instance, though contextually it fits within the encoding suggested in the PDF's Appendix C.

## Examples

```
. - / J. S. / Note: Full name of author: John Smith.
```

```
. - / [s.n.] / Note: Publisher identified as Acme Press based on printer's device.
```

```
. - / Ed. / Note: Editor's name varies in subsequent volumes; see area 7 for details.
```

```
. - / Smith, J. / Note: Statement of responsibility taken from cover.
```

```
. - / [M.M.] / Note: Full name of composer: Maria Martinez, according to Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.
```


## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** Directly related to the statement of responsibility in Area 1.  Can also be related to notes in other areas if the statement of responsibility contains information also found in those areas (e.g., information about edition, translation, etc.).
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** This element can be considered a sub-type of a more general "note" element. Specific instances could relate to a sub-type like a "note on translator" or a "note on editor."
- **Inverse Relationships:**  Not explicitly defined in the ISBD.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** The ISBD emphasizes recording only statements of *principal* responsibility in Area 1. Notes can be used to record statements of secondary responsibility if they are considered important.
- **Exceptions:** There are stipulations allowing parts of the statement of responsibility to be included in Area 4 (Publication, etc., area) or in other areas if linguistically linked. In those cases, a note might be necessary to clarify the situation.
- **Best Practices:** Provide notes when there is ambiguity or missing information in the statement of responsibility that would be beneficial to the user.  Keep notes concise and relevant.  Use standard abbreviations where appropriate. Be consistent in applying these practices across records.
