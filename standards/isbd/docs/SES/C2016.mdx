# Title And Statement Of Responsibility Area Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This element within the **Material Description Area (Area 5)** provides a statement of 
**additional physical characteristics** of the resource beyond its extent and dimensions. 
This includes details like material composition, presence of colour or illustrations, and various technical specifications.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
<p>All elements are optional:</p>
- **Composition of material:** Word or phrase indicating what the resource is made of 
    (e.g., "wood," "nitrate," "transparency").
- **Presence of illustrations:** Abbreviation "ill." (or equivalent). 
    Can specify "all ill." or "chiefly maps".
- **Presence of colour:** "col." for colour, "b&amp;w" for black and white.
- **Reduction ratio (Microforms):** Numerical ratio (e.g., "14x," "150x") 
    or descriptive terms (e.g., "low reduction").
- **Presence or absence of sound:** "sd." for sound, "si." for silent, when not implicit in 
    the specific material designation (e.g., for film reels). Brief explanatory phrases can be added (e.g., "(Beta HiFi)").
- **Other technical specifications:**
  - **Frame alignment** (for microforms/filmstrips, 
        e.g., "cine mode," "comic mode").
  - **Process or method of reproduction** (for still images, 
        e.g., "drypoint, aquatint").
  - **Playing speed** (e.g., "33 1/3 rpm," "19 cm/s").
  - **Recording method** (e.g., "stereo," "mono").
  - **Groove direction/size** (for sound discs).
  - **Number of tape tracks**.
  - **Track configuration** (for sound reels with 4+ tracks).
  - **Number of sound channels** (e.g., "mono," "stereo").
  - **Equalization**.
  - **Noise reduction**.

    omitted here and given in **Area 8 (Resource Identifier and Terms of Availability Area)** 
    or the **Note Area (Area 7)**.
- Notes providing additional physical details or peculiar characteristics are given in 
    the **Note Area (Area 7)**.

</div>

## Examples
