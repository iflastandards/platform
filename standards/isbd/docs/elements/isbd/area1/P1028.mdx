# has other title information of series or multipart monographic resource

The ISBD element "other title information of series or multipart monographic resource" is found within the PDF documentation. Here's a breakdown of the element according to your requested structure:

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** This element provides additional title information that is subordinate to the main series title. It helps clarify the nature or focus of the series, aids in distinguishing it from similar series, and enhances the searchability and retrievability of records.  It often provides contextual information about the series that is not conveyed by the title proper.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  Improved resource discovery, identification, and selection by users. Enables more precise searching in catalogs and databases. Facilitates disambiguation of similar series titles.

## Element Values

- **Specific Rules/Guidelines:** Transcribe other title information exactly as to wording from the prescribed source (series title page, analytical title page, etc.), but not necessarily as to capitalization and punctuation (6.3). Enclose information taken from a source other than the prescribed sources in square brackets (6.3).
- **Value Constraints/Formats:** No specific format is prescribed, but conciseness is generally preferred.
- **String Encoding Schemes:** No specific encoding scheme mentioned, but assumes compatibility with the character set used for the rest of the record.


## Examples

```
(Pricing and buying : an annotated bibliography)
(Advances in polymer science : Fortschritte der Hochpolymeren-Forschung)
(The German pre-classics : selected works)
(Carte géologique de la France à 1:50 000 : feuille Lille)
(企業管理基礎 : 教師用)
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** Subordinate to the "title proper of a series or multipart monographic resource" element (6.1).  May be related to statements of responsibility for the series (6.4) if the other title information clarifies the role of the responsible party.  If the series title consists of a common title and a dependent title, other title information relating to the dependent title is given after the dependent title, while other title information relating to the common title may be given in area 7 (6.3.2).
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** None explicitly defined.
- **Inverse Relationships:**  None explicitly defined.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations/Exceptions:**  When the title proper of a series consists of a common title and a dependent title, other title information for the common title may be omitted or placed in a note (7.6.1) (6.3.2). If the other title information is not found on a prescribed source but elsewhere on the resource, it is enclosed in square brackets.
- **Best Practices:** Use other title information judiciously to provide essential context and enhance searchability. Avoid redundant information that is already conveyed by the title proper or other elements.  Be consistent in application across records.
