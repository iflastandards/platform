# has common title of title proper

The ISBD element "common title of title proper" is part of a larger structure within the Title Proper (1.1).  It is explained as a component used when constructing titles for resources that are part of, or supplement, another resource. This element appears in the ISBD as "Common title (of title proper)".

## Element Reference

- **Definition:** The title proper can consist of a common title and a dependent title, with or without a dependent title designation.

- **Domain:** Title Proper (1.1) of a resource that is part of a larger work, such as a series, multipart monograph, or supplement.
- **Range:** String representing the title common to multiple related resources.
- **Element type:** Sub-element of the Title Proper.


## Additional Information

- **Scope and purpose:**  The common title indicates the relationship between the resource being described and the larger work to which it belongs. It clarifies the context of the dependent title.

- **User tasks supported:**  Facilitates identification and collocation of resources belonging to the same series or multipart monograph. Improves searching and browsing of related materials.


## Element Values

- **Specific rules/guidelines:** The common title is transcribed exactly as it appears on the prescribed source of information (usually the title page). It is the first element transcribed when the title proper consists of a common title and a dependent title.

- **Value constraints/formats:** No specific format constraints are mentioned, however, transcription rules from section 1.1.5 apply.

- **String encoding schemes:** Follows general ISBD encoding practices (see A.5 Language and script of the description).



## Examples

```
International Journal of .  Quantum Chemistry.  Symposium
```

```
Advanced calculus. Student handbook
```

```
Histoire du peuple anglais au XIXe siècle. Épilogue
```

```
Ordnance Survey of Great Britain one inch to one mile map. Seventh series. 
```

```
The German pre-classics. Series A
```


## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:**  The common title is always followed by the Dependent Title (either directly or after a Dependent Title Designation). The common title may also be recorded in the Series and Multi-part Monographic Resource Area (Area 6).  This happens when the larger resource to which the described resource belongs is itself part of a larger series structure (see 1.1.4.6.1).

- **Super-types:** Title Proper (1.1)
- **Sub-types:**  None explicitly mentioned.
- **Inverse relationships:**  None explicitly defined in the ISBD.



## Stipulations

- **Special considerations:**  If the common title is linguistically integral to the dependent title or other descriptive elements, it is included within the dependent title itself and not treated as a separate common title (see 1.1.3.6, 1.3.2).

- **Best practices:**  Clarity and consistency in applying the distinction between common title and dependent title are essential.  When a resource belongs to multiple series, the series statements should be recorded in Area 6.
