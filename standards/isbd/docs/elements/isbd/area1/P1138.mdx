# has dependent title of title proper

The ISBD element "dependent title of title proper" is not explicitly defined as a separate, standalone element within the 2021 update to the ISBD. However, the concept is present within the larger context of "common title and dependent title" covered in section 1.1.3.7 and throughout Area 6 (Series and Multi-Part Monographic Resource Area). Dependent titles exist for other areas too, like Area 6, so it's important to understand it's not just for titles. It's just not broken out as a separate, distinct element labeled "dependent title of title proper."  The information below reflects this embedded nature.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and purpose:**  Clarifies and provides more specific information about the resource identified by the common title. It often indicates a part or section of a larger work or series.
- **User tasks supported:** Helps users understand the relationship of the part to the whole, aids in precise identification and retrieval of specific parts of larger resources.


## Element Values

- **Rules and guidelines:** The dependent title is transcribed from the prescribed source exactly as to wording (but not necessarily capitalization). It follows the common title and dependent title designation if any.
- **Value constraints or formats:** None explicitly stated for the dependent title portion itself. However, stipulations for the title proper as a whole apply.
- **String encoding schemes:** No specific encoding scheme mandated within ISBD; follows general cataloging practices.

## Examples

```
Common Title. Dependent Title
Internationale Quartär-Karte von Europa. Blatt 8, Magnitogorsk
Crecer como hijos de Dios. Libro del catequista
Nueva enciclopedia Larousse. Suplemento
Advanced calculus. Student handbook
Histoire du peuple anglais au XIXe siècle. Épilogue
```

## Relationships

- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:**  Directly related to the "common title" element and connected by prescribed punctuation (a period followed by a space). It is part of the larger "title proper" element when the title is composed of a common and dependent title.  In Area 6, it's related to other series information like the common title or the series title.
- **Super-types:** Title proper, series title
- **Sub-types:** None explicitly defined, but specific types of dependent titles can be inferred from context (e.g., section title, part title).
- **Inverse relationships:**  A dependent title implies the existence of a "common title" or "series title."

## Stipulations

- **Special considerations:**  The ISBD emphasizes that the common and dependent title structure applies to various situations, including sections of larger works, subseries of series, and parts of multipart monographs.
- **Best practices:**  Ensure clear identification of both common and dependent title elements. If necessary, provide additional explanatory notes in Area 7. If the dependent title exists in Area 6, then other series information should be given as appropriate.
