## Risk Management

### Risk Matrix

```yaml
High Probability / High Impact:
  - User resistance to change
    Mitigation: Extensive training, gradual rollout
  
  - Data migration errors
    Mitigation: Automated validation, rollback capability

High Probability / Low Impact:
  - Minor bugs during transition
    Mitigation: Rapid response team, hot fixes
  
  - Temporary performance issues
    Mitigation: Scaling preparation, monitoring

Low Probability / High Impact:
  - Major security vulnerability
    Mitigation: Security audits, penetration testing
  
  - Complete system failure
    Mitigation: Backup systems, disaster recovery

Low Probability / Low Impact:
  - Feature requests during migration
    Mitigation: Feature freeze, clear roadmap
```

### Contingency Plans

#### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Full System Rollback
1. Freeze new system changes
2. Export any new data
3. Restore legacy system from backup
4. Redirect traffic to legacy
5. Communicate rollback to users
6. Analyze failure points

# Partial Rollback (per vocabulary)
1. Identify affected vocabulary
2. Restore vocabulary-specific data
3. Update routing for that vocabulary
4. Maintain others on new system
5. Fix issues in isolation
```

#### Parallel Operation Strategy
- Both systems remain operational
- Read traffic can use either system
- Write traffic gradually migrated
- Daily sync between systems
- Clear system-of-record designation
