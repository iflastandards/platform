# is item reflected in

The element "is item reflected in" (isbd:elements/P1195) is **not explicitly defined** within the provided ISBD documentation.  While the ISBD standard focuses on describing the physical and intellectual characteristics of resources, it primarily handles relationships between different *manifestations* of a work (e.g., translations, reproductions) rather than relationships between the *item* and other entities.

The concept of an item being "reflected in" suggests a relationship where the item serves as the basis or inspiration for another resource.  This kind of relationship is often expressed within the ISBD's Note Area (Area 7), using general notes to provide details about related resources.

Since the specific element is absent, the following sections outline how such a relationship might be expressed within the current ISBD framework using the Note Area:

## Element Reference (Approximation using Note Area)

- **Approximated Definition (using Note Area):**  A note indicating another resource that reflects, is derived from, or is based on the described item.
- **Domain:** The item being described.
- **Range:** Another resource (which might be another manifestation of the same work or a completely different work).
- **Element Type:**  Relationship (expressed as a note).

## Additional Information (Approximation using Note Area)

- **Scope and Purpose:** To document relationships where the described item has influenced the creation of another resource.  This could include adaptations, artistic interpretations, critical analyses, scholarly studies, etc.
- **User Tasks:** Enables users to discover related resources that provide different perspectives on or interpretations of the original item.


## Element Values (Approximation using Note Area)

- **Rules/Guidelines:**  Use clear, concise language to describe the relationship. Provide sufficient bibliographic information to identify the related resource.  Follow the guidelines for citing resources within notes as outlined in the ISBD.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:**  No strict format, but generally includes the title of the related resource and other identifying information as needed (author, date, etc.).
- **String Encoding:**  Follow the general ISBD guidelines for language and script of the description.


## Examples (Approximation using Note Area)

```
Note:  Served as inspiration for Picasso's painting "Guernica".
```

```
Note:  Adapted as a play by Tom Stoppard, titled "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead".
```

```
Note:  Analyzed in the critical study "The Hidden Meanings of Moby Dick" by John Smith (New York: Some Publisher, 2023).
```

```
Note: Basis for the dataset "Environmental Data for Coastal Regions of California, 1980-2020".  Available at: [URL or DOI].
```


## Relationships (Approximation using Note Area)


- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:** Expressed as a note within Area 7. May be related to information provided in other areas, such as the Title and Statement of Responsibility Area (Area 1).


## Stipulations (Approximation using Note Area)


- **Special Considerations:** Use with caution to avoid overly subjective or speculative connections between resources.  Focus on documented and verifiable relationships.
- **Best Practices:** Provide specific details about the nature of the relationship whenever possible.  Use established terminology for describing relationships between resources (e.g., "adaptation," "analysis," "basis for").  If the related resource is available online, provide a URL or DOI.


It is important to note that this is an approximation of how the "is item reflected in" concept could be handled within the existing ISBD structure.  A formal definition and inclusion of such an element within a future revision of the ISBD would provide greater clarity and consistency in its application.
