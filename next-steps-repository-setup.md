# Next Steps for Repository Setup

You now have:
1. ✅ **Configuration updated** - Removed development environment, prepared for Vercel
2. ✅ **Code committed** - Clean commit ready to push to new repository

## What you need to do next:

### 1. Create the New Repository
Go to GitHub and create `iflastandards/platform`:
- **Empty repository** (no README, gitignore, or license)
- **Private or Public** (your choice)
- **Don't initialize** with anything

### 2. Set Up Git Remotes
Once the repository exists, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the new platform remote
git remote add platform git@github.com:iflastandards/platform.git

# Rename your current dev branch to preview
git branch -m dev preview

# Push to the new repository
git push -u platform preview

# Create and push main branch
git checkout -b main
git push -u platform main
git checkout preview
```

### 3. Configure Vercel
- Connect Vercel to `iflastandards/platform`
- Set **preview branch** as the deployment branch
- Configure build settings for Nx monorepo

#### Vercel Build Settings:
- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Build Command**: `pnpm build:all`
- **Output Directory**: Leave empty (Nx handles this)
- **Install Command**: `pnpm install`
- **Root Directory**: Leave as root

#### Environment Variables:
```
DOCS_ENV=preview
NODE_VERSION=22
```

### 4. Update the Vercel URL
Once Vercel gives you the actual URL, update `siteConfig.ts` to replace `platform-preview.vercel.app` with the real Vercel URL.

### 5. Optional: Clean Up Old Remotes
After everything is working, you can remove the old remotes:

```bash
# Remove the fork remote (optional)
git remote remove fork

# Remove the old origin if you want (optional)
# git remote remove origin
```

### 6. Test the Complete Workflow
1. Make a small change locally
2. Commit and push to `platform preview`
3. Verify Vercel builds and deploys
4. Check that all sites work correctly

## Your New Simplified Workflow

### Daily Development:
```bash
# Work on preview branch
git add .
git commit -m "work in progress"
git push platform preview
# → Triggers Vercel preview deployment
```

### Production Release:
```bash
# Merge to main when ready for production
git checkout main
git merge preview
git push platform main
# → Deploy to production (when you set that up)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Simpler**: Only 3 environments instead of 4
2. **No fork needed**: Direct push to organization repo
3. **Vercel integration**: Automatic previews on every push
4. **Nx optimization preserved**: No changes to build system
5. **Clean production**: Empty main branch for clean releases
6. **Your workflow preserved**: Keep working the way you prefer

## Configuration Summary

The configuration is ready! Your code is now prepared for the simplified 3-environment structure:

- **local**: Development on your machine (localhost ports)
- **preview**: Vercel-hosted previews from `platform/preview` branch
- **production**: Final production deployment (www.iflastandards.info)

The next step is creating the GitHub repository and setting up Vercel.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Nx Cloud**: May need to update workspace ID for new repo
2. **Build failures**: Check Vercel build logs for Nx-specific issues
3. **Environment detection**: Verify the new environment logic works correctly
4. **URL updates**: Make sure to update the placeholder Vercel URL once you have the real one

The configuration changes have been tested and committed successfully. You're ready to proceed with the repository creation!
