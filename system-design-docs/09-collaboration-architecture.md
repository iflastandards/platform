# Collaboration Architecture

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Proposed Implementation

## Overview

This document details the collaboration architecture that enables IFLA's globally distributed standards development work. Built on GitHub's platform capabilities, the system provides structured project management, transparent workflows, and inclusive participation models that align with IFLA's governance structure while enabling efficient global collaboration.

## GitHub Project-Based Collaboration Model

### Core Concept

The collaboration architecture centers on GitHub Projects as the primary organizing unit for all standards development work. This model, inspired by W3C working groups, provides focused, goal-oriented collaboration while maintaining clear governance boundaries and enabling external participation.

### Project Structure

```yaml
Review Group (Parent):
  └── Projects (Chartered Work):
      ├── Short-term (3-6 months):
      │   ├── Translation initiatives
      │   ├── Specific updates
      │   └── Cross-namespace harmonization
      └── Long-term (1-3 years):
          ├── Maintenance working groups
          ├── Major revisions
          └── New standard development
```

### Project Charter Components

Each Project includes:
- **Scope Definition**: Clear boundaries of work
- **Deliverables**: Specific outputs and milestones
- **Timeline**: Start date, milestones, expected completion
- **Team Composition**: Core members and allowed external contributors
- **Namespace Assignment**: Which namespaces the Project can modify
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes

## Organizational Alignment

### Review Group Structure

The four primary Review Groups manage distinct namespace domains:

```
1. International Cataloguing Principles (ICP)
   └── Namespaces: icp, muldicat

2. Bibliographic Conceptual Models (BCM)
   └── Namespaces: frbr, lrm, frad

3. International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD)
   └── Namespaces: isbd, isbdm

4. Permanent UNIMARC Committee (PUC)
   └── Namespaces: unimarc, mri
```

### Permission Model

```typescript
interface ProjectPermissions {
  reviewGroup: ReviewGroupId;           // Parent authority
  namespaces: NamespaceId[];           // Assigned work areas
  teamMembers: {
    core: GitHubUser[];                // Full access
    contributors: GitHubUser[];         // Limited access
    observers: GitHubUser[];           // Read-only access
  };
  expiresAt?: Date;                    // For time-limited projects
}
```

## GitHub Platform Integration

### 1. Projects and Boards

GitHub Projects provide kanban-style visual management:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Project: LRM French Translation         │
├─────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────┤
│   Backlog   │  In Progress │   Review     │    Done    │
├─────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼────────────┤
│ □ Terms A-C │ □ Terms M-O  │ □ Terms D-F  │ ✓ Overview │
│ □ Terms P-R │ □ Examples   │              │ ✓ Terms G-L│
│ □ Terms S-Z │              │              │            │
└─────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────┘
```

**Features**:
- Automated card movement based on pull request status
- Milestone tracking for major deliverables
- Progress visualization and burndown charts
- Custom fields for vocabulary-specific metadata

### 2. Pull Request Workflows

Structured contribution process for all participants:

```mermaid
graph LR

    D -->|Approve| E[Merge to Main]
    D -->|Request Changes| B
    E -->|Deploy| F[Published Standard]
```

**Pull Request Template**:
```markdown

- Pull request validation
- Automated testing
- Preview deployments
- Production releases

### 2. Notification System

```typescript
interface NotificationRules {
  projectActivity: {
    newIssue: ['project-team', 'watchers'];
    pullRequest: ['project-team', 'reviewers'];
    milestone: ['project-team', 'review-group'];
  };
  escalation: {
    stalePR: { after: '14 days', notify: ['project-lead'] };
    blockedIssue: { after: '30 days', notify: ['review-group'] };
  };
}
```

### 3. Analytics and Reporting

Project metrics tracked:
- Contribution velocity
- Time to resolution
- Participation rates
- Quality metrics

## Security and Access Control

### GitHub Single Sign-On

```typescript
interface AuthenticationFlow {
  provider: 'github';
  requirements: {
    twoFactorAuth: required;
    emailVerified: required;
  };
  sessionManagement: {
    timeout: '8 hours';
    refreshable: true;
  };
}
```

### Project-Based Permissions

```yaml
Permission Matrix:
  Project Member:
    - Read: all project resources
    - Write: assigned namespaces only
    - Delete: own contributions only
  
  Project Lead:
    - Read: all project resources
    - Write: all project namespaces
    - Delete: project resources
    - Admin: project settings
  
  Review Group Admin:
    - All Project Lead permissions
    - Create: new projects
    - Assign: team members
    - Archive: completed projects
```

- Automated Project setup workflows
- Cross-Project dependency tracking
- Portfolio-level reporting

This collaboration architecture provides the foundation for IFLA's distributed standards development, enabling efficient global participation while maintaining quality and governance standards.
