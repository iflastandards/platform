# has note area

The ISBD element "note area" is found in the PDF and corresponds to section 7.

## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD Definition:** The note area contains any descriptive information that has not been given in other areas of the description but that is considered to be important to users of bibliographic records. (Section 7, Introductory note)

- **Domain and Range:**  While not explicitly defined in RDF terms in the document, the domain would be the bibliographic resource being described, and the range would be a textual note.

- **Element Type:**  Literal (textual data).


## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** The scope is any descriptive information not covered by the prescribed areas.  The purpose is to qualify and amplify the description in the other areas and can deal with any aspect of a resource, including bibliographic history and relationships to other resources.  (Section 7, Introductory note)

- **User Tasks Supported:**  The note area assists users in:
    - Gaining a deeper understanding of the resource being described.
    - Disambiguating information in other areas.
    - Understanding the resource's history and context.
    - Identifying related resources.



## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:**
    - Notes should be concise and factual.
    - Two or more notes can be combined when appropriate.
    - Prescribed punctuation of areas 1-6 should be followed within notes when referencing a resource.
    - Enough information must be provided to identify another resource referenced in a note. (Section 7, Introductory note, Prescribed Punctuation)

- **Value Constraints and Formats:**  No strict format, but guidelines encourage clarity and consistency.  Specific stipulations are given for referencing continuing resources (key title and ISSN), which should be used when applicable.

- **String Encoding:**  Not specified, but assumes a character encoding compatible with the rest of the record (e.g., UTF-8).

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** Notes can relate to any area of the ISBD description.  Specific subsections within the Note Area are organized by area (e.g., 7.1 for Title and Statement of Responsibility, 7.2 for Edition, etc.).

- **Sub-types:**  The note area has several sub-types based on the area to which they apply, outlined in the "Contents" of section 7.  Examples include notes on the title proper (7.1.1), edition (7.2), and so forth.

- **Inverse Relationships:** Not explicitly defined.



## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** The order of notes within the note area is generally optional, except for electronic resources where the system requirements and mode of access notes are given first (when applicable). (Section 7.0.3 and 7.0.4)

- **Best Practices:**
    - Use notes judiciously to provide essential information that doesn't fit in other areas.
    - Be consistent in phrasing and punctuation.
    - Prioritize notes that aid in identification and disambiguation.
    - Use standard abbreviations where appropriate (see Appendix D).
    - For complex or extensive notes, consider a supplementary document or linked resource.
