- [ ] Verify basePath configurations are correct
- [ ] Ensure environment-aware URLs are properly configured

### Phase 2: Build System Preparation
- [ ] Optimize Nx cache and daemon (`pnpm nx:optimize`)
- [ ] Start Nx daemon for performance (`pnpm nx:daemon:start`)
- [ ] Clear any stale build artifacts if needed (`pnpm nx:cache:clear`)
- [ ] Verify Nx Cloud integration is functioning
- [ ] Check port availability and kill conflicting processes (`pnpm ports:kill`)
- [ ] Validate workspace configuration (`nx workspace`)

- [ ] Push changes to preview branch
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions deployment pipeline
- [ ] Verify Vercel preview deployment succeeds
- [ ] Test deployed preview site functionality
- [ ] Validate all site navigation and cross-links
- [ ] Check admin portal functionality on preview
- [ ] Verify vocabulary management features work
- [ ] Test authentication flows on deployed environment
- [ ] Document any deployment issues or lessons learned

### Phase 6: Post-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Perform smoke tests on all deployed sites
- [ ] Verify search functionality works across sites
- [ ] Test form submissions and API integrations
- [ ] Check performance metrics and load times
