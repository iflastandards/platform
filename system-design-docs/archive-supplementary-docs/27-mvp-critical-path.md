# MVP Critical Path Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Execution Ready

## Overview

This document defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and critical path implementation plan for the IFLA Standards Platform, focusing on the most essential features needed to replace legacy systems and enable core workflows.

## MVP Scope Definition

### Core Requirements

The MVP must support (in priority order):
1. **Import/Export Workflows**: Google Sheets import for bootstrapping vocabularies
2. **Basic Admin Functions**: User management, namespace administration
3. **GitHub Integration**: Basic project and issue tracking
4. **TinaCMS Integration**: WYSIWYG content editing capabilities
5. **Legacy URL Compatibility**: All existing vocabulary URIs must continue to work
6. **Publishing Pipeline**: Ability to publish vocabularies with proper redirects

### Out of Scope for MVP

These features will be implemented post-MVP:
- Advanced translation workflows
- AI-powered features
- Comprehensive analytics
- Advanced project management features

## Updated Critical Path Timeline (Reprioritized January 2025)

### **Phase 1 - Weeks 1-4: Import/Export Workflows** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

**Why First**: Import/Export workflows are the foundation for all vocabulary bootstrapping and data migration. Without the ability to import from Google Sheets and export to various formats, no content can flow through the system.

**Deliverables**:
```yaml
Week 1: Google Sheets Integration Foundation
  - Service account authentication setup
  - Google Sheets API client configuration
  - Basic read/write operations
  - Rate limiting and quota management

Week 2: Import Pipeline Development
  - CSV/DCTAP validation engine
  - Error handling and reporting system
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Data transformation utilities

Week 3: Export Pipeline Development
  - Multiple format export (CSV, RDF, JSON-LD)
  - Template-based generation system
  - Quality validation before export
  - Integration with existing build pipeline

Week 4: Integration Testing & Optimization
  - End-to-end workflow testing
  - Performance optimization
  - Error recovery mechanisms
  - User interface for import/export operations
```

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Import/Export Pipeline Structure
interface ImportConfig {
  sourceType: 'google-sheets' | 'csv' | 'json';
  namespace: string;
  validationRules: DCTAPValidationConfig;
  transformationRules: DataTransformationConfig;
  batchSize: number;
  errorThreshold: number;
}

interface ExportConfig {
  targetFormat: 'csv' | 'rdf' | 'json-ld' | 'turtle';
  namespace: string;
  includeMetadata: boolean;
  compressionLevel: 'none' | 'gzip' | 'brotli';
  outputPath: string;
}

// Google Sheets Service
class GoogleSheetsService {
  async authenticate(serviceAccountKey: string): Promise<void>;
  async readSheet(spreadsheetId: string, range: string): Promise<SheetData>;
  async writeSheet(spreadsheetId: string, range: string, data: any[][]): Promise<void>;
  async validatePermissions(spreadsheetId: string): Promise<boolean>;
}

// Import Pipeline
async function importFromGoogleSheets(config: ImportConfig): Promise<ImportResult> {
  // 1. Authenticate and validate permissions
  // 2. Read data with error handling
  // 3. Apply validation rules
  // 4. Transform data format
  // 5. Generate MDX files
  // 6. Update vocabulary metadata
}
```

### **Phase 2 - Weeks 5-8: Basic Admin Functions** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY

**Why Second**: User management and namespace administration are essential for controlling access to the import/export workflows and maintaining data integrity.
