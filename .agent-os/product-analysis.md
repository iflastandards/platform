- Multi-stage testing pipeline
- Automated deployment to GitHub Pages

## Testing Strategy

**Testing Levels:**
1. **Unit Tests**: Vitest with React Testing Library
2. **Integration Tests**: API and component integration
3. **E2E Tests**: Playwright with multiple browser support
4. **Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparison
5. **Performance Testing**: Load testing and metrics

**Test Organization:**
- Tagged test system (@unit, @integration, @e2e, @critical)
- Phase-based execution (pre-commit, pre-push, CI)
- Smart test selection with Nx affected

## Development Workflow

**Commands & Scripts:**
- 360+ npm scripts for various operations
- Nx commands for efficient development
- Custom scripts for scaffolding and automation
- Dev server management tools

**Quality Gates:**
- ESLint with strict TypeScript rules
- Pre-commit and pre-push hooks
- Type checking enforcement
- Secret scanning

## Data Architecture

**Data Sources:**
- File system (MDX, JSON, YAML)
- Google Sheets for vocabulary data
- Supabase for dynamic content
- RDF/XML for semantic data

**Data Flow:**
- Import from spreadsheets → MDX generation
- RDF parsing → CSV conversion
- Cross-format validation
- Multi-language support

## Performance Optimizations

- Nx daemon for faster builds
- Parallel execution (12 cores)
- Distributed caching with Nx Cloud
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Lazy loading and code splitting

## Unique Features
