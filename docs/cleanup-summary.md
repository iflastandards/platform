# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Purpose:** Summary of files removed and references updated

## Files Removed (6 files)

### Never-Implemented System Documentation
1. **developer_notes/clerk-cerbos-integration-plan.md** - Described Cerbos integration that was never built
2. **system-design-docs/15-cerbos-to-clerk-migration.md** - Migration that never happened
3. **system-design-docs/15-clerk-rbac-implementation-plan.md** - Different approach was used
4. **system-design-docs/14-clerk-rbac-architecture.md** - Replaced by cleaner implementation doc

### Cleanup Tracking Files
5. **docs/cerbos-cleanup-complete.md** - Temporary tracking file
6. **docs/cerbos-references-cleanup.md** - Temporary tracking file
7. **docs/system-design-docs-update-summary.md** - Temporary tracking file

## Files Renamed

1. **system-design-docs/14-current-rbac-implementation.md** → **14-rbac-implementation.md**
   - Simpler, cleaner name for the actual implementation documentation

## References Updated

### Files with updated references:
- **developer_notes/authentication-authorization-architecture.md** - Updated path to RBAC implementation
- **developer_notes/admin-portal-authentication-architecture.md** - Updated path to RBAC implementation
- **developer_notes/RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Removed references to deleted files
- **DEPRECATED_TESTS_MIGRATION_LOG.md** - Updated to reflect Cerbos was never implemented
- **system-design-docs/README.md** - Updated file list and technology stack

## Current State

The documentation now accurately reflects:
- ✅ Custom RBAC implementation via Clerk publicMetadata
- ✅ Standard Next.js API routes (not tRPC)
- ✅ No Cerbos (never implemented)
- ✅ No Clerk Organizations (simpler approach chosen)

All references to unimplemented systems have been either:
- Removed entirely (if the file had no value)
- Updated with implementation notes (if the file has historical value)

## Result

The codebase is now cleaner with:
- 7 unnecessary files removed
- All references updated to point to correct documentation
- Clear distinction between what was planned vs what was implemented
