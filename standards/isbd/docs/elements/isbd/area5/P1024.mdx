# has dimensions

The ISBD element "dimensions" (isbd:elements/P1024) is found within Area 5, the Material Description Area, of the ISBD.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:**  The dimensions element provides information about the physical size of a resource.  This is crucial for identification, handling, shelving, and storage considerations. It also helps users understand the format and physical presentation of a resource.  For example, the dimensions help distinguish between a pocket atlas and a large-format atlas.
- **User Tasks Supported:**
    - Identifying a specific resource among similar titles.
    - Determining if a resource is appropriate for a particular purpose (e.g.,  interlibrary loan, digitization).
    - Making informed decisions about shelving and storage.


## Element Values

- **Specific Rules and Guidelines:**
    - Generally, dimensions are given in centimeters (cm) rounded *up* to the nearest whole centimeter.
    - For printed books, the height is measured parallel to the spine.
    - For maps, height x width is given. If there's no neat line, dimensions of the geographically detailed portion are given. For globes, the diameter is provided.
    - For sound recordings, the diameter of the disc is given, not the container.
    - For microfilm, the gauge of the film is provided.
    - For older materials, the bibliographic format (folio, quarto, octavo, etc.) may be used along with the height of the resource in parentheses.
- **Value Constraints and Formats:**  Height x Width x Depth (for 3D objects); Height x Width (for 2D objects); Diameter (for circular objects); Height (for books).  Gauge is given in millimeters (mm) for film.  Appropriate units should be clearly indicated (cm, mm, inches).
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  UTF-8 is generally recommended.


## Examples

```
; 25 cm
```

```
; 50 x 75 cm (folded to 25 x 13 cm) 
```

```
; 30 cm (diam.)
```

```
; 33 1/3 rpm ; 30 cm
```

```
; 16 mm, 1800 ft ; 18 cm (reel)
```



## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD Elements:** Closely related to the `extent` element, which describes the number of physical units (volumes, discs, etc.). Dimensions complements extent by giving the size of those units.  Also relates to `other physical details`, as details about color, illustrations, and sound are given before dimensions in Area 5. For older monographic resources it is closely related to the `bibliographic format` statement.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:** N/A
- **Inverse Relationships:** N/A


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** When a resource comes in a container, the dimensions of the resource itself should be given, not the container (unless it is an integral part of the resource).  If dimensions are given for both the resource and its container, two separate dimension statements should be provided. When dealing with multi-part items with varying sizes, the largest dimensions may be given followed by "or smaller" or a note may be made in area 7 about the varying sizes. If a component part's dimensions can be inferred from the description of the host resource and its location within it, it might be omitted from the component part's description.
- **Exceptions:** For some older or special collections, traditional bibliographic formats (e.g., folio, quarto) may be used instead of or in addition to explicit centimeter measurements.
- **Best Practices:**  Consistency in using units (cm, mm, or inches) within a catalog is essential. It is important to be clear about what is being measured (e.g., resource itself vs. container). Notes in Area 7 can clarify any ambiguity or provide more detailed dimensional information where necessary. Always round centimeter measurements *up* to the nearest whole number.
