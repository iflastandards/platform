# Architecture Evolution Timeline

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Historical Evolution Documentation

## Overview

This document traces the chronological evolution of the IFLA Standards Platform architecture, highlighting what has been superseded, what remains current, and the rationale behind major architectural changes.

## Timeline of Major Architectural Changes

### Phase 1: Initial Architecture (Early 2024)

#### Original Design
- **Environment Files Era**: 36+ `.env` files across sites
- **Factory Functions**: Complex site creation patterns
- **Dual Repository Strategy**: Development fork + preview repository
- **4 Environments**: local, development, preview, production

#### Key Characteristics
- Environment variables drove all configuration
- Cross-contamination issues between sites
- Complex CI/CD with Nx Cloud on multiple repos
- Personal fork workflow for development

### Phase 2: Dual CI Implementation (June 2025)

#### What Was Built
- **Dual CI Architecture**: Separate CI for development and preview
- **Repository Split**:
  - `jonphipps/standards-dev` (fork) - Comprehensive testing
  - `iflastandards/standards-dev` (preview) - Light validation
- **Nx Cloud**: Running on development fork only
- **Git Aliases**: `push-dev` and `push-preview`

#### Problems It Solved
- Cost-efficient Nx Cloud usage
- Fast client preview deployments
- Comprehensive development testing

**Status**: ⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - Replaced by simplified architecture

### Phase 3: Configuration Centralization (December 2024)

#### Major Refactor
- **From**: 36+ environment files
- **To**: Single TypeScript configuration matrix
- **Location**: `libs/shared-config/src/lib/siteConfig.ts`

#### Key Improvements
```typescript
// Before: Multiple .env files
// portal/.env.local, portal/.env.preview, etc.

// After: Centralized matrix
export const SITE_CONFIG: Record<SiteKey, Record<Environment, SiteConfigEntry>> = {
  portal: {
    local: { url: 'http://localhost:3000', baseUrl: '/', port: 3000 },
    preview: { url: 'https://iflastandards.github.io', baseUrl: '/platform/' },
    production: { url: 'https://www.iflastandards.info', baseUrl: '/' },
  },
  // ... all sites in one place
};
```

**Status**: ✅ **CURRENT** - Active architecture

### Phase 4: Repository Simplification (January 2025)

#### Current State
- **Single Repository**: `iflastandards/platform`
- **Simplified Branches**: 
  - `main` (production)
  - `preview` (staging)
  - Feature branches for development
- **3 Environments**: local, preview, production (development deprecated)
- **No Fork Workflow**: Direct development on main repository

#### What Was Deprecated
- Dual CI architecture
- Personal fork development
- Separate development environment
- Complex Nx Cloud setup across repos

**Status**: ✅ **CURRENT** - Active architecture

### Phase 5: Admin Portal Evolution (2024-2025)

#### Initial Design
- Planned as subdomain: `admin.iflastandards.info`
- Complex authentication flow
- Separate deployment pipeline

#### Current Implementation
- **basePath Architecture**: `/admin` path on main domain
- **Environment-Aware**: Automatic URL adaptation
- **Simplified Auth**: Integrated with main platform

**Status**: ✅ **CURRENT** - Active architecture

## Deprecated Architectures Reference

### 1. Dual CI Architecture (June 2025)
**Files**: 
- `developer_notes/dual-ci-architecture.md`
- `.github/workflows/nx-optimized-ci.yml` (on fork)

**Replaced By**: Simplified single-repository CI/CD

**Reason for Deprecation**:
- Complexity of maintaining two CI systems
- Confusion about which repository to use
- Simplified to single repository with branch-based deployments

### 2. Environment-Based Configuration (Pre-December 2024)
**Files**:
- `developer_notes/abandoned/ENV_CONFIGURATION_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`
- Various `.env.*` files throughout the codebase

**Replaced By**: Centralized TypeScript configuration matrix

**Reason for Deprecation**:
- Cross-contamination between sites
- Difficult to maintain 36+ files
- Type safety issues
- Runtime environment loading complexity

### 3. Four-Environment Strategy
**Original**: local, development, preview, production

**Current**: local, preview, production

**Reason for Change**:
- Development environment was redundant
- Simplified deployment pipeline
- Reduced configuration complexity

### 4. Fork-Based Development Workflow
**Original**: Personal forks for development

**Current**: Feature branches on main repository

**Reason for Change**:
- Simplified collaboration
- Single source of truth
- Easier CI/CD configuration

## Current Architecture Summary

### How Architecture Evolved Beyond PRD Requirements

The platform's architecture has evolved significantly beyond the original Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifications, introducing innovative solutions to complex problems:

#### 1. Documentation Management Evolution

**PRD Requirement**: Basic template system with version control

**Architectural Evolution**:
- **TinaCMS Integration**: WYSIWYG editing for non-technical users
- **Complex MDX Support**: Handles both RDF frontmatter and prose content
- **Component Integration**: Live preview with actual React components
- **GitHub Organization Auth**: Seamless authentication using existing membership

```typescript
// Advanced preview architecture beyond PRD scope
export function TinaPreview({ query, variables }) {
  const { data } = useTina({ query, variables });
  const frontmatter = transformRDFData(data.frontmatter);
  const content = (
    <MDXRemote
      source={data.body}
      components={components}
      scope={{ ...frontmatter }}
    />
  );
}
```

#### 2. Translation Workflow Revolution

**PRD Requirement**: Crowdin integration with version locking

**Architectural Innovation - Version-Based Synchronization**:
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    Published_v1 --> Export_to_Sheets: Start v2
    Export_to_Sheets --> Sheets_Unlocked: MDX → Sheets
    Sheets_Unlocked --> Translation_Work: Translators work
    Translation_Work --> Import_to_MDX: One-time import
    Import_to_MDX --> Sheets_Locked: Lock sheets
    Sheets_Locked --> MDX_Editing: TinaCMS/Git editing
```

**Key Innovations**:
- Three distinct translation workflows (spreadsheet, Crowdin, hybrid)
- English modification handling with translator feedback
- Single source of truth with clear transitions
- Eliminates complex bidirectional sync issues

#### 3. Vocabulary Server Enhancement

**PRD Requirement**: Basic URI resolution server

**Architectural Expansion**:
```yaml
# Advanced redirect mapping
URI: http://iflastandards.info/ns/isbd/terms/1001
HTML: https://www.iflastandards.info/isbd/docs/vocabularies/contentTypes/Text

# Lexical alias support
Canonical: http://iflastandards.info/ns/isbd/terms/1001
English: http://iflastandards.info/ns/isbd/terms/Text
French: http://iflastandards.info/ns/isbd/terms/Texte
```

**Performance Requirements** (beyond PRD):
- Redirect latency < 10ms (95th percentile)
- Support 10K+ mappings per namespace
- Handle 1000+ requests/second
- Zero downtime deployments
