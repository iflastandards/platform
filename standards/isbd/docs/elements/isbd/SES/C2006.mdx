# Material Or Type Of Resource Specific Area Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This area (Area 3) is specifically designed to contain <strong>data unique to a particular class of material or type of resource</strong>. It groups together specific elements for cartographic resources, notated music, serials, and unpublished resources.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
The elements in this area are material-specific:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mathematical data (Cartographic resources) (Mandatory if applicable):</strong> Includes statement of scale, projection, coordinates, celestial hemisphere, epoch, equinox, and magnitude. (Further detailed in "Mathematical Data Area Encoding Scheme").</li>
  <li><strong>Music format statement (Notated music) (Mandatory if available):</strong> A term describing the physical form of presentation of notated music (e.g., "Full score," "Parts"). (Further detailed in "Music Format Statement Area Encoding Scheme").</li>
  <li><strong>Numbering (Serials) (Mandatory if available):</strong> Numeric and/or chronological designations of the first and/or last issues or parts of a serial. (Further detailed in "Numbering Area Encoding Scheme").</li>
  <li><strong>Unpublished statement (Optional):</strong> A term or phrase indicating the category, nature, or production method of an unpublished resource (e.g., "Master tape," "[Manuscript]"). This element was introduced in the 2021 Update to extend ISBD's coverage.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
The punctuation patterns are specific to each type of material and are set out within their respective sub-sections. The area as a whole is preceded by <strong>. —</strong>. If repeated, each repetition is preceded by <strong>. —</strong>.
</div>

## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
Identified as <strong>Area 3</strong>, this area allows for specialized descriptive data tailored to different resource types, promoting granular description and harmonization.
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
<ul>
  <li>It contains distinct encoding schemes for "Mathematical Data," "Music Format Statement," and "Numbering" for specific material types.</li>
  <li>Physical details of materials described here (like the actual pages of a score or the dimensions of an unpublished manuscript) are often provided in the <strong>Material Description Area (Area 5)</strong>.</li>
  <li>Notes on this area, providing additional mathematical or numbering details, are found in the <strong>Note Area (Area 7)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Examples

<div className="stip">
```
. — Scale 1:250 000 ; universal transverse Mercator proj. (Cartographic)

. — Full score (Notated Music)

. — Vol. 1, no. 1 (Jan. 1971)– (Serials)

. — Master tape (Unpublished)
```
</div>
