# Material Description Area Encoding Scheme

## Element Reference
<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Definition

<div className="guid">
This area (Area 5) describes the **physical characteristics** of the resource. It includes details about the extent, other physical characteristics, dimensions, and any accompanying material. The description should reflect the resource as it was originally issued.
</div>

## Required Elements

<div className="guid">
- **Extent (Mandatory):** Names and numbers the physical unit(s) (e.g., "36 slides," "1 computer disk") 
    and may include subunits like pages or playing time (e.g., "(37 p.)", "(ca 60 min)"). 
    (Further detailed in "Specific Material Designation And Extent Encoding Scheme").
- **Other physical details (Optional):** Statement of other characteristics, such as:
  - **Composition of material** (e.g., "wood," "nitrate").
  - **Presence of illustrations** (e.g., "ill.", "col. ill.", "chiefly maps").
  - **Presence of colour** (e.g., "col.", "b&amp;w").
  - **Reduction ratio** (for microforms, e.g., "14x", "high reduction").
  - **Presence or absence of sound** (e.g., "sd.", "si.").
  - **Other technical specifications** (e.g., frame alignment, process of reproduction, playing speed, 
        sound channels, noise reduction). (Further detailed in "Other Physical Details Encoding Scheme").
- **Dimensions (Optional):** Linear measurements of the resource, typically in centimetres. 
    For certain media (film, tape), gauge or width in millimetres.
- **Accompanying material statement (Optional):** Describes any physically separable material issued with 
    and intended to be used with the resource. A short physical description of the accompanying material may be included.

</div>

## Punctuation Rules

<div className="guid">
- Each area is preceded by **. —**.
- The **statement of other physical details** is preceded by **:**.
- The **dimensions statement** is preceded by **;**.
- Each **accompanying material statement** is preceded by **+**.
- **Extent, other physical details, and dimensions of accompanying material** are enclosed in 
    **parentheses ( )**.

</div>

## Relationship to ISBD Standards

<div className="guid">
Identified as **Area 5**, this is a key area for providing physical description of resources. 
It provides unambiguous information for identification and reference.
</div>

## Relationship to Other SES

<div className="guid">
- It contains distinct encoding schemes for "Specific Material Designation And Extent Encoding Scheme" 
    and "Other Physical Details Encoding Scheme."
- Information about the physical units of notated music and unpublished resources mentioned in Area 3 
    is specified here.
- Notes on this area provide additional physical details or clarify peculiarities, 
    and are found in the **Note Area (Area 7)**.
- Accompanying material can alternatively be described independently or in a note.

</div>

## Examples

<div className="stip">
```
. — Specific material designation (extent) : other physical details statement ; dimensions 
+ accompanying material statement

. — 1 score (37 p.) + 4 parts on 1 CD-ROM

. — 1 videocassette (U-matic) (30 min) : col., sd. ; 18.8 x 10.4 x 2.5 cm

. — 1 map : transparency, col. ; 65 x 40 cm + 1 memoir
