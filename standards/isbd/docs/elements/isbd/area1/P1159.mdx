## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**
  - Abridgements are allowed in certain cases for very long titles, but only in the middle or at the end, never at the beginning. The first five words must always be transcribed. Omissions are indicated with an ellipsis. (1.1.5.1)
  - For older resources and manuscripts, specific rules for handling abbreviations, misprints, and title page information apply. (Various subsections within Section 1)
  - Specific transcription and punctuation rules are provided for each sub-element.
- **Best Practices:** Transcribe exactly as found in the prescribed source, applying the detailed guidelines provided in Section 1 for handling specific situations (e.g. multiple titles, incomplete titles, different language titles). Consult the full text of the ISBD standard for all applicable rules and exceptions.  Pay particular attention to the prescribed punctuation as this is crucial for parsing and interoperability.
