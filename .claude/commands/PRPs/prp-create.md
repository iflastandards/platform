# Create PRP for Feature: $ARGUMENTS

Generate a complete PRP for feature implementation with deep and thorough research. Ensure rich context is passed to the AI through the PRP to enable one-pass implementation success.

## Research Process

1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Search for similar features/patterns in the codebase
   - Identify all necessary files to reference
   - Note existing conventions to follow
   - Check test patterns for validation approach

2. **External Research**
   - Find relevant documentation (include URLs)
   - Search for implementation examples
   - Document best practices and common pitfalls
   - Add critical docs to PRPs/ai_docs/ if needed

3. **User Clarification**
   - Ask for any missing requirements

## PRP Generation

Using the PRP template, include:
- All necessary context (docs, examples, gotchas)
- Implementation blueprint with pseudocode
- Executable validation gates
- Clear task breakdown

## Output

Save as: `PRPs/{feature-name}-prp.md`

Remember: The goal is one-pass implementation success through comprehensive context.
