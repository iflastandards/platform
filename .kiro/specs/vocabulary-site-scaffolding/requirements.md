# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building proper structure, navigation, and landing pages for existing IFLA Standards Docusaurus sites. The sites currently exist as placeholder scaffolds but lack the proper index pages, navigation structure, and landing pages needed to present their vocabulary data effectively.

Based on the successful implementation patterns established in ISBDM and ISBD sites, this system will generate the missing structural components for the remaining sites (LRM, FRBR, MulDiCat, UNIMARC, etc.) using the existing vocabulary data and the established UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Namespace Overview Landing Pages

**User Story:** As a Standards User, I want comprehensive landing pages for each namespace that show all available element sets and vocabularies, so that I can understand the scope and structure of each standard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a namespace site root THEN the system SHALL display a NamespaceHub component showing all element sets and vocabularies for that namespace
2. WHEN the landing page is generated THEN it SHALL include statistics, descriptions, and navigation links for each element set and vocabulary
3. WHEN the page loads THEN it SHALL follow the established pattern from ISBDM and ISBD sites with proper branding and navigation

### Requirement 2: Element Set Index Pages and Navigation

**User Story:** As a Standards User, I want to browse element sets with proper categorization and navigation, so that I can find specific elements efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to an element set THEN the system SHALL display an index page with element categories and browsing capabilities
2. WHEN element sets have multiple categories THEN the navigation SHALL organize elements by their logical groupings (statements, notes, attributes, relationships)
3. WHEN the site has multiple element sets THEN the navigation SHALL provide clear switching between element sets within the same namespace

### Requirement 3: Vocabulary Index Pages and Term Browsing

**User Story:** As a Standards User, I want to browse vocabularies with proper term listings and search capabilities, so that I can find and understand vocabulary terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a vocabulary THEN the system SHALL display an index page with all terms and their definitions
2. WHEN vocabularies contain many terms THEN the system SHALL provide search, filtering, and pagination capabilities
3. WHEN terms have hierarchical relationships THEN the navigation SHALL display these relationships clearly

### Requirement 4: Multi-Element Set Site Architecture

**User Story:** As a Standards Developer, I want sites with multiple element sets to have proper navigation and organization, so that users can understand the relationships between different element sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a namespace contains multiple element sets THEN the site SHALL organize them with clear hierarchy and cross-references
2. WHEN users navigate between element sets THEN the system SHALL maintain context and provide easy switching mechanisms
3. WHEN element sets share vocabularies THEN the navigation SHALL show these relationships clearly

### Requirement 5: Automated Sidebar Generation

**User Story:** As a Standards Developer, I want sidebar navigation to be automatically generated based on the site structure, so that navigation stays consistent and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a site is built THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate sidebar navigation based on the element sets and vocabularies present
2. WHEN the site structure changes THEN the sidebar SHALL automatically update to reflect the new organization
3. WHEN sites have complex structures (like UNIMARC with 24+ element sets) THEN the sidebar SHALL use hierarchical grouping for usability

### Requirement 6: Cross-Site Navigation Integration

**User Story:** As a Standards User, I want consistent navigation between related standards sites, so that I can easily move between different but related standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sites are built THEN they SHALL include proper cross-site navigation using the existing SiteLink components
2. WHEN users are viewing related content THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant content from other sites
3. WHEN navigation is generated THEN it SHALL respect the Review Group structure and relationships

### Requirement 7: Responsive Design and Mobile Navigation

**User Story:** As a Mobile User, I want vocabulary sites to work well on mobile devices with appropriate navigation, so that I can access standards information on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sites are accessed on mobile devices THEN the navigation SHALL adapt to mobile-friendly patterns
2. WHEN complex navigation exists THEN mobile users SHALL have access to simplified navigation menus
3. WHEN vocabulary tables are displayed THEN they SHALL be responsive and usable on small screens

### Requirement 8: Search Integration and Filtering

**User Story:** As a Standards User, I want to search across element sets and vocabularies within a site, so that I can quickly find specific information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sites are built THEN they SHALL include search functionality that covers all element sets and vocabularies
2. WHEN search results are displayed THEN they SHALL indicate which element set or vocabulary contains each result
3. WHEN users need to filter THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by element set, vocabulary, or content type

### Requirement 9: Template-Based Page Generation

**User Story:** As a Standards Developer, I want page generation to use templates that can be customized for different types of sites, so that I can maintain consistency while allowing for site-specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are generated THEN they SHALL use templates that can be customized based on site type and content
2. WHEN templates are applied THEN they SHALL maintain consistency with the established design patterns from ISBDM and ISBD
3. WHEN customization is needed THEN the template system SHALL allow overrides without breaking core functionality

### Requirement 10: Integration with Existing Components

**User Story:** As a Platform Maintainer, I want the page generation system to use existing UI components, so that the sites maintain consistency with the overall platform design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are generated THEN they SHALL use the existing NamespaceHub, ElementSetCard, and VocabularyCard components
2. WHEN navigation is built THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing theme and component system
3. WHEN sites are deployed THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing build and deployment processes

### Requirement 11: Automated Content Discovery

**User Story:** As a Standards Developer, I want the system to automatically discover existing vocabulary data and structure, so that I don't need to manually configure every aspect of the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a site is processed THEN the system SHALL automatically discover existing RDF files, CSV data, and MDX content
2. WHEN content is discovered THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate site structure and navigation
3. WHEN new content is added THEN the system SHALL automatically incorporate it into the site structure

### Requirement 12: Batch Processing for Multiple Sites

**User Story:** As a Platform Maintainer, I want to process multiple sites efficiently, so that I can update all sites with improved structure and navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple sites THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently in batch operations
2. WHEN sites are processed THEN the system SHALL preserve existing customizations while adding missing structure
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of changes made to each site
