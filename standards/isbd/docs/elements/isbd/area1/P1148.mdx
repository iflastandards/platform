# has dependent title of series or multipart monographic resource

The requested element, "dependent title of series or multipart monographic resource," is present within the ISBD documentation but is referred to as simply "Dependent title" within the context of series and multipart monographic resources. It is explained as a component of a larger concept involving a "Common title" and is not treated as a standalone element in the way the RDF presents it.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

**Scope and Purpose:** To provide more specific or focused title information within a broader series or multipart resource.  It distinguishes individual resources or parts within the larger series/multipart context.

**User Tasks Supported:**
- Identifying a specific resource within a series or multipart item.
- Disambiguation between resources with the same common title.
- Understanding the hierarchical structure of complex resources.

## Element Values

**Rules and Guidelines:** The dependent title should be transcribed exactly as it appears on the resource. Abbreviations are allowed as they appear.

**Value Constraints and Formats:**  No specific character encoding scheme is stipulated but proper transcription from the resource into the record is assumed.

## Examples

```
(Common Title. Dependent Title)

(Publications of the University of Manchester. Administration series)
(Geological research reports. Map series)
(Das Erbe deutscher Musik. Abteilung Oper und Sologesang)
(Arte moderna straniera. Serie C, Disegnatori)
(Sounds of the theatre. Music)
```

## Relationships

**Relationship to Other ISBD Elements:** The dependent title is directly related to the `common title` element (or `title proper of series`), which it cannot function without. It is part of the series statement (Area 6). It may also be related to a `dependent title designation`, which acts as numbering for the dependent title section.

**Super-types and Sub-types:** None explicitly defined within ISBD.  "Section Title" is listed as "see also" in the glossary definition, but not as a true subtype.

**Inverse Relationships:**  None explicitly defined within ISBD.

## Stipulations

**Special Considerations:**
- When a series title consists of both a common title and dependent title, other title information (Area 6.3) associated with the dependent title is given *after* the dependent title.
- For older monographic resources, if a series title contains a dependent title and a dependent title designation, the designation may be omitted when the series information is taken from sources other than the title page, and a note about the omission may be made in the notes area.

**Best Practices:**  Ensure consistent application of the rules for transcribing dependent titles to facilitate accurate identification and retrieval of resources. When devising a series title for cataloging purposes, follow existing standards or create titles that clearly distinguish individual resources within the series.
