# has note on content form and media type

The ISBD element "note on content form and media type" is found within the broader "Note Area" and specifically discussed as part of section 7.0, "Notes on the content form and media type area and for special types of material".  It does not have its own distinct named element definition like some other notes.

## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:**  To provide additional information about the content form and/or media type that is considered important to users but doesn't fit within the structured elements of Area 0. This might involve clarifying ambiguities, explaining unusual formats, or providing details not covered by the controlled vocabulary.
- **User Tasks Supported:** Aids in resource discovery and selection by providing a more complete understanding of the resource's format and how its content is expressed.


## Element Values

- **Rules/Guidelines:** Notes should be concise and factual. They may be based on information found on the resource itself or derived from external sources.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:** No specific format is mandated, but clarity and conciseness are encouraged.
- **String Encoding:**  UTF-8 is the recommended encoding for ISBD.

## Relationships

- **Relationships to Other ISBD Elements:** Directly related to Area 0 (Content Form and Media Type Area). May also be related to information in other areas, such as Area 5 (Material Description Area), if the note explains or expands on details provided there.
- **Super-types/Sub-types:**  This is a sub-type of "Note" within the ISBD structure.  There are no further sub-types defined for notes specifically on content form and media type.
- **Inverse Relationships:**  None specified.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  Use of this note is optional and at the discretion of the cataloger. It should only be used when the information is deemed important for users and cannot be readily expressed within the formal elements of the description.
- **Best Practices:** Be concise and factual.  Avoid subjective evaluations or interpretations of the content.  Clearly indicate the source of information if it is not from the resource itself.  Use standard terminology and abbreviations where appropriate.
