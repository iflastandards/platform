# LRM Entity-Relationship Model

IFLA LRM is a high-level conceptual reference model developed by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.

## Overview

The IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM) consolidates three previously separate IFLA conceptual models:
- FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records)
- FRAD (Functional Requirements for Authority Data)  
- FRSAD (Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data)

The consolidation was designed to:
- Resolve inconsistencies between the three separate models
- Create a single, streamlined, and logically consistent model
- Support use in linked data environments

## Model Development

The development process involved examining every user task, entity, attribute and relationship from the original models. Definitions were revised and remodeled as needed to create a comprehensive approach to bibliographic data representation.

The model brings bibliographic data modeling up-to-date with current conceptual modeling practices while maintaining compatibility with linked data environments.
