# has note on resource identifier and terms of availability

The ISBD element "note on resource identifier and terms of availability" is discussed within the broader context of the "Note Area" (Area 7) in the ISBD documentation. It doesn't have its own distinct definition as a standalone element like "title" or "edition."  Therefore, I will respond to the prompt by focusing on the relevant notes within Area 7 that pertain to resource identifiers and terms of availability.


## Element Reference


<ElementReference frontMatter={frontMatter} />

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** These notes provide additional information related to how the resource can be identified and/or obtained.  This can include details about limited print runs, restricted distribution, specific binding information if issued by the publisher, or explanations about standard numbers and their qualifications.  For older materials, information about bindings, privilege dates, and locations in standard bibliographies are included here.

- **User Tasks Supported:**  The information in these notes helps users:
    - Understand the availability and limitations of a resource.
    - Identify specific copies or editions.
    - Locate resources in library catalogs or other systems.
    - Assess the rarity or uniqueness of a resource.



## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** Notes should be concise and factual.  They may be transcribed from the resource itself or supplied by the cataloger.  When taken from the resource, the source of the note (e.g., colophon, accompanying material) should be specified.

- **Value Constraints and Formats:**  No strict format is prescribed, but the use of standard abbreviations is encouraged.  Numeric information (like print runs or edition sizes) should be in Arabic numerals.

- **String Encoding:**  UTF-8 is the recommended encoding for ISBD records.



## Examples

```
. - Note: 250 copies printed.

. - Note: Limited edition of 50 signed copies, not for sale.  Available for reference use only.

. - Note: First edition limited to 100 copies in vellum binding.

. - Note: BMC, vol. XI, p. 13, no. 18. Goff, G-47. (Example of a bibliographic reference note for older monographic resources or manuscripts)

. - Note:  Software distributed with resource is for demonstration purposes only and is not fully functional. (Example of a note related to availability for electronic resources)
```


## Relationships

- **Relationship to other ISBD elements:** These notes are supplementary to the information provided in Area 8 (Resource Identifier and Terms of Availability Area) and may clarify or expand upon the information given there. They can also be related to information in Area 5 (Material Description Area) concerning binding.

- **Super-types and Sub-types:** None explicitly defined.

- **Inverse Relationships:** None explicitly defined.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** Notes should only be included if they provide information not readily apparent from other areas of the description.

- **Best Practices:**  Be consistent in the wording and style of notes.  Use standard abbreviations where possible. Clearly indicate the source of information if transcribed from the resource.  Avoid subjective or evaluative comments.


It's important to remember that Area 7 of the ISBD is intended for notes that don't fit neatly into other designated areas.  The guidelines encourage flexibility, allowing catalogers to include notes as necessary to provide a complete and accurate description of the resource.
