/**
 * E2E TEST EXAMPLE - IFLA Standards Platform
 * ==========================================
 * 
 * CATEGORY: End-To-End Tests (@e2e tag)
 * PURPOSE: Simulate user workflow through UI and backend systems
 * EXECUTION: Periodically as part of CI pipelines
 * 
 * DIRECTORY PLACEMENT:
 * - Root level `e2e/`
 * 
 * REQUIRED TAGS: @e2e
 * 
 * NX TARGETS THAT RUN THIS TEST:
 * - nx run-many --target=e2e --all
 * - pnpm test:e2e (causes full system test run)
 * 
 * GIT HOOKS THAT MAY RUN THIS TEST:
 * - Pre-merge: Pre-release checks for critical regressions
 * 
 * WHY THIS IS AN E2E TEST:
 * - Interacts through the full system layer, simulating user behavior
 * - Spans frontend to backend, involving network calls and database
 * - Can demonstrate real-world scenarios including edge cases like timeouts
 * - Helps verify changes from a user perspective in various environments

/**
 * SUMMARY OF E2E TEST CHARACTERISTICS:
 * 
 * ‚úÖ REALISTIC: Simulates actual user interactions in the app
 * ‚öñÔ∏è COMPLEX: Must simulate real-time conditions and manage potential A/B tests
 * üåç COMPREHENSIVE: Covers typical paths taken by a user interacting with the service
 * üîó CONNECTED: Validates each layer's functionality and interconnectivity
 * ü§ñ AUTOMATED: Scenarios run weekly/nightly to catch issues early
 * 
 * WHEN TO RUN: Scheduled and pre-merge branches against staging
 * WHERE TO PLACE: Under `e2e/` giving easy access for full-suite tests
 * HOW TO EXTEND: Add common user journeys, simulate various roles and permissions
