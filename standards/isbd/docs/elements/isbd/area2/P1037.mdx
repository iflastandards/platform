# has note on edition area and bibliographic history

The ISBD element "note on edition area and bibliographic history" (isbd:elements/P1037) is found within the broader Note Area (Area 7) of the ISBD standard. The standard does not explicitly define individual note types as distinct elements in the same manner as other areas like Title or Edition.  Instead, it provides categories and examples of notes related to different areas of the bibliographic description.  Therefore, this response focuses on the characteristics of notes related to edition and bibliographic history *as a type of note* within Area 7, rather than as a formal ISBD element.


## Element Reference

- **ISBD Definition:** The ISBD does not provide a specific, separate definition for “note on edition area and bibliographic history” as a distinct element. It’s covered within the general stipulations for Area 7 (Notes). Area 7 is defined as "containing any descriptive information that has not been given in other areas of the description but that is considered to be important to users of bibliographic records. Notes qualify and amplify the description in the other areas and can deal with any aspect of a resource. Notes may also give the bibliographic history of the resource and indicate relationships to other resources." (Section 7, Introduction).  Section 7.2 specifically discusses "Notes on the edition area and the bibliographic history of the resource".
- **Domain and Range:** Not formally defined as the Note Area is treated as a container for various types of free-text notes.
- **Element Type:**  Free text note within the Note Area.


## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** These notes provide additional information about the edition being described that hasn't been recorded in Area 2 (Edition Area) and context related to the bibliographic history of the resource that might be relevant to users, such as previous publication details, former titles, relationships to other resources, etc.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  Aids in resource identification and selection by providing more complete information about a particular edition and its history, helping users distinguish between different editions or publications of the same work.


## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:**  Notes should be concise and clear. They should follow the prescribed punctuation of Areas 1-6 where appropriate (e.g., when citing titles).
- **Value Constraints and Formats:** No strict format, but examples in the standard often use phrases like "Originally published:", "Previously issued as:", "Reprint of:", "Revised edition of:", etc. to introduce the note content.
- **String Encoding:** No specific encoding scheme stipulated, as the language and script follow the general rules for the description.

## Relationships

- **Relationship to Other ISBD Elements:** Relates to Area 2 (Edition Area) by providing supplementary edition information and relates to Area 7 (Note Area) as a specific type of note. Can also relate indirectly to Area 1 (Title) and Area 4 (Publication) when providing information about former titles or publication details of earlier editions.
- **Super-types and Sub-types:**  Not applicable, as notes are not formally structured as a type hierarchy.
- **Inverse Relationships:** Not applicable.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:**  The standard encourages conciseness and clarity in notes.  The level of detail provided can vary depending on the resource and the cataloging agency's policy.  For older monographic resources, provenance information can also be included in these notes.
- **Best Practices:**  Be consistent in the phrasing and format of notes. When citing related resources, provide enough bibliographic information to clearly identify them.


It's crucial to understand that these notes, along with all notes in Area 7, are meant to be flexible and to accommodate information that is judged to be important but doesn't fit neatly into the prescribed areas of the bibliographic description. The cataloger uses their judgment to determine what information is valuable enough to include in a note.
