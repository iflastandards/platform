# has parallel statement of responsibility of series or multipart monographic resource

The ISBD element "parallel statement of responsibility of series or multipart monographic resource" is found within the Series and Multipart Monographic Resource Area (Area 6). It represents a statement of responsibility that is presented as an equivalent to another statement of responsibility for the series in a different language and/or script. It is analogous to the parallel title for the title proper.

## Element Reference

- **Official ISBD Definition:**  A statement of responsibility relating to a series or multipart monographic resource that is a direct translation or linguistic equivalent of another statement of responsibility, and that appears on the resource in a different language and/or script from the statement of responsibility recorded as the main statement of responsibility for the same series.
- **Domain:** Series or multipart monographic resource.
- **Range:** String (representing the statement of responsibility in a parallel language/script).
- **Element Type:** Descriptive.

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** To provide equivalent statements of responsibility for a series in multiple languages and/or scripts, thereby improving international accessibility and understanding of the role of the person(s) or body(ies) responsible for the series.
- **User Tasks Supported:**
    - Identifying the agents responsible for a series, regardless of the user's language.
    - Facilitating retrieval and collocation of series resources across different language versions.

## Element Values

- **Rules/Guidelines:** The parallel statement of responsibility should be transcribed exactly as it appears on the resource, following the same transcription guidelines as for the main statement of responsibility (see 1.4).  Capitalization and punctuation should follow the conventions of the language and script used.
- **Value Constraints/Formats:** No specific format is prescribed other than adherence to general statement of responsibility transcription rules.
- **String Encoding Schemes:**  The encoding scheme used for the script should be noted if it is not Unicode.

## Examples

```
(Monografías del Instituto de Investigaciones Históricas / Universidad Nacional
Autónoma de México = Research Monographs of the Institute of Historical
Research / National Autonomous University of Mexico)
```

```
(Estudios sobre la historia de España / Real Academia de la Historia  = Studies on
the history of Spain / Royal Academy of History)

```

```
(Série orange : carte topographique de la France à 1:50 000 / Institut Géographique
National = Orange Series: Topographical map of France at 1:50 000 /  National
Geographic Institute)

```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD Elements:**  Closely related to the "Statement of responsibility relating to a series or multipart monographic resource" (6.4) and the "Parallel title of a series or multipart monographic resource" (6.2).  If a parallel title exists for the series, the parallel statement of responsibility should follow the same parallel structure.
- **Super-types/Sub-types:** None explicitly defined in ISBD.
- **Inverse Relationships:** None defined.


## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations/Exceptions:** If the statement of responsibility appears as an integral part of the series title itself, it would be included in the series title proper (6.1) and not treated as a separate statement of responsibility.
- **Best Practices:**  Ensure consistency in the presentation of parallel statements of responsibility across all records within a catalog.  If a parallel title exists for the series, the parallel statement of responsibility should follow the corresponding parallel title. Clarify the relationship between different agents mentioned in parallel statements of responsibility using appropriate linking words or punctuation if needed.
