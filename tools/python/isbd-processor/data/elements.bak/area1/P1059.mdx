# has statement of responsibility relating to an additional edition statement

The ISBD element "statement of responsibility relating to an additional edition statement" is found within the larger context of the "Edition Area" and specifically addressed in section 2.5 of the ISBD:2021 update document. It is referred to as "Statement of responsibility relating to an additional edition, drafting, version, etc. statement."

## Element Reference

- **Definition:**  Names, phrases, or groups of characters indicating the function of agents responsible for an edition of the resource that is subsequent to the first named edition and identified as such on the source. This might include revisers, editors of reprints within an edition, etc.
- **Domain:**  Resources with an additional edition statement (2.4).
- **Range:**  Names of persons or corporate bodies.
- **Element Type:**  Descriptive.

## Additional Information

- **Scope and Purpose:** To provide information about agents responsible for a specific iteration or version of the resource *within* a larger edition, when that version is formally identified as distinct by an additional edition statement. This distinguishes it from the general statement of responsibility related to the primary edition statement.
- **User Tasks Supported:**  This element aids users in understanding the nature of different iterations or versions within an edition (e.g., a revised reprint) and attributing responsibility for those changes. It provides more granular information than just the primary edition statement.


## Element Values

- **Rules and Guidelines:** Transcribed in accordance with the provisions of section 2.3 (Statement of responsibility relating to the edition, drafting, version, etc.) of the ISBD.  This means following general rules for statements of responsibility, including the order of names, use of linking words or phrases to indicate function, and handling of multiple agents.
- **Value Constraints and Formats:** No specific formats prescribed other than the general guidelines for statements of responsibility.
- **String Encoding Schemes:** Not applicable. The script and language should match that used in the statement of responsibility for the main edition statement.

## Examples

```
2nd ed., repr. with revisions / prepared by the editorial board.
```

```
Rev. version 3.2, student ed. / adapted by John Smith.
```

```
4th ed., large print version / editor, Mary Jones; proofreader, Jane Doe.
```

```
5th ed., unabridged repr. / with a new foreword by the author.
```

```
10th ed., special anniversary issue / edited and with an introduction by Dr. A. Professor.
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:** This element is directly related to the "Additional edition, drafting, version, etc. statement" (2.4) and follows the general transcription practices outlined in the "Statement of responsibility" element (1.4).
- **Super-types and sub-types:**  Not applicable.
- **Inverse relationships:** Not applicable.

## Stipulations

- **Special Considerations:** If the information about responsibility for the additional edition statement is not found on a prescribed source, it can be given in area 2 enclosed in square brackets or in area 7.
- **Best Practices:** When an additional edition statement names an unchanged reprint (e.g., "2nd ed., 5th printing"), a statement of responsibility is usually not necessary for that reprint unless significant changes involving agents were made.  If in doubt, it's best to include the statement of responsibility if available to ensure clarity.
