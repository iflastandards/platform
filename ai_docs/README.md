# AI Documentation

This directory contains curated documentation for AI-assisted development with Claude Code.

## Purpose

Place library documentation, API references, and other technical documentation here that should be included in the AI's context when working on this project.

## Usage

1. Add markdown files with relevant documentation
2. Reference these files in your PRPs using:
   ```yaml
   - docfile: ai_docs/library-name.md
     why: Specific sections or methods needed
   ```

## Recommended Documentation

Based on your tech stack (nextjs, sass, context, express, supabase, clerk), consider adding:

- Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- React Server Components guide

## File Naming Convention

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `library-name.md`
- Be descriptive: `fastapi-security-best-practices.md`
- Version if needed: `react-19-hooks.md`
