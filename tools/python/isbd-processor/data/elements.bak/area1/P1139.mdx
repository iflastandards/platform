# has dependent title designation of title proper

The requested element, "dependent title designation of title proper" (isbd:elements/P1139), is discussed within the larger context of "Common title and dependent title" in the ISBD documentation. It's not given a standalone, explicitly labeled definition.  The designation is considered an integral part of the larger title proper. Therefore, I have framed the answer in terms of the larger context of common and dependent titles, extracting the relevant information for the dependent title designation from various sections of the ISBD documentation.

## Element Reference

The ISBD doesn't offer an independent definition specifically for "dependent title designation of title proper." Instead, it defines the broader concept of dependent titles, which includes the designation as an optional component.  A dependent title is defined as: "a title that by itself is insufficient to identify a resource and that requires the addition of the common title, or the title of the main resource or the title of the main series." (Appendix E - Glossary) The dependent title designation helps distinguish between multiple related resources that share a common title.

- **Domain:** Title proper of a resource that is part of a larger work (series, multipart monograph).
- **Range:**  A word, phrase, or numbering scheme.
- **Element type:** Part of the title proper (textual).

## Additional Information

- **Scope and purpose:** The dependent title designation, along with the dependent title itself, clarifies the relationship of the resource being described to the larger work to which it belongs. It provides a more specific identification within the context of the common title.
- **User tasks supported:**  Helps users distinguish between different parts or sections of a larger work; facilitates searching and retrieval of specific parts within a series or multipart monograph.


## Element Values

- **Rules and guidelines:** The dependent title designation is transcribed as it appears on the resource, following the common title and preceding the dependent title.  It is grammatically linked to the common title. Numbers or letters can also act as designations.
- **Value constraints and formats:** No strict format is prescribed, but clarity and conciseness are recommended.
- **String encoding schemes:** Not applicable, as it is transcribed text.


## Examples

```
(The German pre-classics. Series A, George Philipp Telemann)
(Mix and match games. Module 1, Letters)
(Internationale Quartär-Karte von Europa. Blatt 8, Magnitogorsk)
(Crecer como hijos de Dios. Libro del catequista)
```

## Relationships

- **Relationships to other ISBD elements:**  The dependent title designation is directly related to the common title and the dependent title and is considered an integral part of the title proper (1.1). It is also related to series statements in area 6.
- **Super-types and sub-types:** Not applicable in the strict sense, as the ISBD does not define a hierarchical typology for designations. However, a broader categorization could be made by the type of designation: textual (e.g., "Series A"), numeric (e.g., "Module 1," "Blatt 8"), or alphanumeric.
- **Inverse relationships:** None defined in the ISBD.



## Stipulations

- **Special considerations:** If the dependent title can stand on its own without the common title, then the designation may not be needed. In such cases, the resource is treated as a separate entity, and the common title is instead placed in the series area. (1.1.4.6) The use of dependent titles and designations is particularly relevant when cataloging a part of a larger work, where the dependent title alone is insufficient for identification.
- **Best practices:**  Transcribe the dependent title designation exactly as it appears on the resource. When constructing a designation, choose a concise form that clearly indicates the part's relation to the common title.  When in doubt, err on the side of inclusion for better clarity and identification.


This response addresses the element by explaining its function within the larger context of dependent and common titles, as a separate definition for the "dependent title designation of title proper" isn't present in the document.
